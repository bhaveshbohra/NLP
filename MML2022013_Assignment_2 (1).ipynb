CockerellRelease Date: January 24, 2023 [EBook #69875]Language: EnglishOriginal Publication: United Kingdom: United Kingdom: Seeley & Co.,1900..Credits: Brian Wilsden, Tim Lindell and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images generously made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)[Pg i]“Indeed,” said the Duke, “I should not have thought you so very\\r\\npretty.”[Vain Kesta, p. 43.][Pg ii][Pg iii][Pg 1-2][Pg 3]\\nThere was once a\\r\\nwindmill which stood on the downs by the sea, far from any town or\\r\\nvillage, and in which the miller lived alone with his little daughter.\\r\\nHis wife had died when the little girl, whose name was Lucilla, was a\\r\\nbaby, and so the miller lived by himself with his child, of whom he was\\r\\nvery proud. As her father was busy with his work, and as little Lucilla\\r\\nhad no other children to play with, she was alone nearly all day,\\r\\nand had to amuse herself as best she could, and one of her greatest\\r\\npleasures was to sit and watch the great sails of the windmill figures like them, and they\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 4]\\r\\n\\r\\nheld each other by the hand, and were dancing and springing from the\\r\\nground as lightly as if they had been made of feather-down.“Come, sisters, come,” cried the one nearest Lucilla. “See, here is a\\r\\nlittle human child out here alone at twelve o’clock at night. Come and\\r\\nlet us play with her.”“Who are you?” asked Lucilla; “my name is Lucilla, and I live in the\\r\\nmill with my father.”“We are windfairies,” said the first grey figure.“Windfairies!” said Lucilla, “what are they?”“We blow the winds and sweep the earth. When there are many of us\\r\\ntogether we make a great hurricane, and human beings are frightened. We\\r\\nit is who turn your mill wheel for you, and make all the little waves\\r\\non the sea. See, if you will come with us we will take you for a ride\\r\\non one of the sails of your mill. That is, if you will be brave, and\\r\\nnot cry.”“I will not cry one bit,” said Lucilla, and she sprang up, and held out\\r\\nher arms.At once she was lifted up, and felt herself going higher and higher,\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 5]\\r\\n\\r\\ntill she rested on one of the great windmill sails, and, with the\\r\\nlittle grey elves beside her, was sweeping through the air, clinging to\\r\\nthe sail.“She is quite good,” whispered one, as she held Lucilla in her tiny\\r\\nwhite arms. “I really think we might teach her to dance, for she has\\r\\nnot cried at all.”“No, she would surely tell some one if we did,” said another. “Little\\r\\nhuman child, would you like us to teach you how to dance as we dance?”“Yes, yes,” cried Lucilla; and now they were sweeping down near the\\r\\nground, and the fairies slid off the sail with Lucilla in their arms,\\r\\nand let her slide gently to earth. “Teach me to dance, I beg. I will\\r\\nnever tell anybody.”“Ah, but that is what all mortals say,” whispered one who had not\\r\\nspoken yet, “no mortal can keep a secret. Never yet was one known who\\r\\ncould be silent.”“Try me,” cried Lucilla again, “I will never tell. Indeed I will not,”\\r\\nand she looked entreatingly from one to another of the elves.“But if you did,” said they, “if you broke your promise to us when\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 6]\\r\\n\\r\\nonce you had made it, we should punish you severely.”“But I promise faithfully,” repeated Lucilla, “I will never tell any\\r\\none.”“Well then, you may try,” they said. “Only remember, if you break\\r\\nyour word to us, and tell any mortal who it was that taught you how\\r\\nto dance, you will never dance again, for your feet will become heavy\\r\\nas lead, and not only that, but some great misfortune will overtake\\r\\nwhatever you love best in this world. But if you keep faith with us,\\r\\nthen the windfairies will never forget you, but will come to your help\\r\\nin your direst hour of need.”“Teach me, teach me,” cried Lucilla; “indeed I will never, never tell,\\r\\nand I long to dance as you do.”“Come then,” they said, and some came behind her, and some went in\\r\\nfront of her, and some took her arms and some her feet, and all at\\r\\nonce Lucilla felt as if she were made of feather-down. She swayed up\\r\\nand down as lightly as they, and it seemed to her quite easy. Never\\r\\nhad she been so happy, and she would gladly have danced for hours, but\\r\\nsuddenly, just as the sun was beginning to show a red light in the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 7]\\r\\n\\r\\nsky, she heard her father’s horse galloping over the downs, and in an\\r\\ninstant the windfairies had vanished.When the miller came up to her, he was angry with her for being out on\\r\\nthe grass instead of warm in bed, but Lucilla dared not tell him what\\r\\nhad kept her, or say that she had been playing with windfairies.Years passed, and Lucilla never saw the windfairies again, though she\\r\\nwatched for them every night. She grew up to be a beautiful young\\r\\nwoman, and her father was very proud of her. She was as tall and as\\r\\nlithe as a willow wand, and when she ran or danced it seemed as if she\\r\\nwere as light as a feather blown in the wind. There were few people\\r\\nto see her, or tell her she was beautiful, for save the fisher folk\\r\\nwho lived in little cottages on the beach, scarce anybody came to the\\r\\ndowns. But all who saw her admired her beauty, and most of all her\\r\\nwonderful dancing. Sometimes she would go out on the downs, and dance\\r\\nand run there by herself, and her father would look at her and say:\\r\\n“Heaven help the maid! I don’t know whom she has learned it from, but\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 8]\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never seen a dancer who can come nigh her.” Then sometimes she\\r\\nwould go down to the sea-shore, and this she loved to do best of all,\\r\\nand there she would dance with the waves, and move with them as they\\r\\nslid up to her feet and drew back, and to those who watched, it seemed\\r\\nas if she and they were one together.The time came when her father wished her to be married, and among the\\r\\nyoung fishermen and the country folk who came to the mill from the\\r\\nfarms across the country, she had suitors enough, but always she said\\r\\nwhen a young man came to woo her, “First let me see how you can dance,\\r\\nfor as dancing is the thing I love best in the world, it would be a\\r\\npity that I and my husband should not be able to dance together,” and\\r\\nas none of them could dance as she did, she sent them all away, saying\\r\\nshe would wait for a husband till she could find a man who could dance\\r\\nto her liking.But one day there was a great storm, and a big ship was blown on to\\r\\nthe shore close to the mill, and among the sailors was a young fellow\\r\\nwith black curly hair and bright eyes and white teeth, and when he saw\\r\\nLucilla, he said to himself, “I will wed that girl and take her home\\r\\nfor my wife.” So one day as they sat on the downs together he begged\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 9]\\r\\n\\r\\nher to marry him, and go back with him to his own land; he said he\\r\\nwould give up going to sea, and would live with her in a little cottage\\r\\nand make their bread by fishing. Then Lucilla said, as she had said\\r\\nto all her other suitors, “First let me see how you can dance, for I\\r\\nwill never marry any man who cannot dance with me.” The sailor swore he\\r\\ncould dance as well as any man in the world, for all sailors can dance,\\r\\nhe said, and they began to dance together on the downs. The sailor\\r\\ndanced well and merrily, but Lucilla danced faster, and seemed as if\\r\\nshe were made of feather-down; and then the sailor, seeing that his\\r\\ndancing was as nothing to hers, caught her by the waist, and held her\\r\\nstill, crying, “My sweetheart, I cannot dance as you can, but my arms\\r\\nare strong enough to hold you still and keep you from dancing with any\\r\\nman but me.”So Lucilla married the sailor, and went with him to live in his little\\r\\ncottage by the sea, many miles away from the mill, and as her father\\r\\nwas growing old and no longer cared to work, he went with her too.[Pg 10]For some time the sailor and Lucilla lived together very happily, and\\r\\nthey had two little children, and her husband fished and sold his fish,\\r\\nand often still, Lucilla would go down to the waves and dance with them\\r\\nas she had done in her old home. She tried to teach her little children\\r\\nto dance as she did, but they could not learn because the windfairies\\r\\nhad never touched them. But one winter her husband’s boat was dashed to\\r\\npieces, and the sea froze so that all the fish died, and they became so\\r\\npoor that they could barely get enough to eat. Then it chanced that a\\r\\nbig ship came to the village where they lived, and the captain wanted\\r\\nmen for a long journey, and her husband told Lucilla that he had best\\r\\ngo with him, and then he would have enough money to buy another boat,\\r\\nand then next year they must hope for better luck. So Lucilla was left\\r\\nalone in the cottage with her father and her two little children, and\\r\\nshe felt very lonely and sad without her husband, and often she thought\\r\\nof the mill and the windfairies, and when the wind blew, she would go\\r\\ndown to the water’s edge and hold out her arms and pray them to take\\r\\ncare of her husband’s ship, and bring it safe home again.[Pg 11]“Oh, kind windfairies,” she cried, “see, I have kept faith with you, so\\r\\ndo you now keep faith with me, and do me no hurt.” And often she would\\r\\ndance by the edge of the waves, as she used to do in her old home, and\\r\\nthink that the windfairies were dancing with her, and holding up her\\r\\nsteps.Now it chanced that one day, as Lucilla was dancing on the shore, there\\r\\nrode by two horsemen, and they stopped and watched her as she danced,\\r\\nwith the waves coming close to her feet. Then they got down from their\\r\\nhorses, and asked who she was, and where she had learned such dancing.\\r\\nShe told them she was only the wife of a poor fisherman, but she had\\r\\ndanced for long years, since she was a little child, when she had lived\\r\\nin a windmill, on the downs far away. They rode away, but next day they\\r\\ncame again, and brought others with them, and begged Lucilla that she\\r\\nwould go down to the water’s edge and dance with the waves as she had\\r\\ndone yesterday. So she ran down the beach, and danced in time to the\\r\\nsea as it moved, and the strangers all applauded, and said to each\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 12]\\r\\n\\r\\nother, “It is wonderful, it is marvellous.”They then told her that they came from a country where the King loved\\r\\nnothing so much as beautiful dancing, and that he would give great sums\\r\\nof money to any one who danced well, and if she would go back with them\\r\\nto his court, and dance before the King, she should have a sack of gold\\r\\nto take home with her, and this would make her a rich woman, and her\\r\\nhusband would never have need to work any more.At first she refused, and said her husband was away, and would not\\r\\nknow where she was gone, and she did not like to leave her two little\\r\\nchildren; but still the courtiers persuaded her, and said it would not\\r\\nbe for long, and her father persuaded her too, since he said it would\\r\\nmake them all rich if she brought home a sack of gold. So at last\\r\\nLucilla agreed that she would go back with them to the King’s court\\r\\nand dance there, but she made them promise that before the spring came\\r\\nthey would send her back to her own little cottage. On hearing this,\\r\\nthe strangers were much delighted, and bid Lucilla make ready to start\\r\\nat once, and that night she said good-bye to her little ones, and\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nleft them, to go with the travellers. Her eyes were red with crying at\\r\\nleaving her home, and before she started, she went out alone on to the\\r\\ncliffs, and stretched out her arms, and called to the windfairies to go\\r\\nwith her and help her, for she feared what she was going to do, and she\\r\\nbegged them to be true to her, as she had been true to them.They sailed for many days, till at last they came to a country of which\\r\\nLucilla had never even heard, and to a big town, which seemed to her\\r\\nas if it must hold all the people in the world, so crowded was it, and\\r\\nabove the town on the hill, they pointed out to her a royal palace, and\\r\\ntold her it was where the King dwelt, and there she would have to dance\\r\\nere the week was out.“And it is most lucky we saw you just now,” said they, “for the King is\\r\\njust going to be married, and in a few days the Princess will arrive,\\r\\nand there will be festivities and rejoicing for days, and at some of\\r\\nthese you will appear before their Majesties, and be sure you dance\\r\\nyour very best.”Then Lucilla went with them into a great hall close to the palace,\\r\\nwhere musicians were playing on every kind of instrument, and here the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 14]\\r\\n\\r\\ncourtiers bid her dance on a platform at one end of the hall, in time\\r\\nto the music; and when they had seen it, the musicians one and all lay\\r\\ndown their instruments, and rose together, clapping and applauding, and\\r\\nall declared that it was the greatest of luck that the travellers had\\r\\nmet with Lucilla, and that it would delight the King more than anything\\r\\nthey had prepared for him.By and by the Princess who was to marry the King arrived, and the\\r\\nwedding was celebrated with much magnificence, and after the wedding\\r\\nthere was a feast, and in the evening there was to be singing and\\r\\ndancing, and all sorts of play for the royal couple and the court to\\r\\nsee, and then Lucilla was to dance. The courtier who brought her wished\\r\\nher to be dressed in the most gorgeous dress, with gold and jewels, but\\r\\nshe pleaded that she might wear a light grey gown like the windfairies,\\r\\nbecause she remembered how they looked when they danced on the downs.When the evening came when she was to dance before the King, she threw\\r\\nwide her window and held out her arms, and cried out, “Now help me,\\r\\ndear windfairies, as you have done before; keep faith with me, as I\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 15]\\r\\n\\r\\nhave kept faith with you.” But in truth she could scarce keep from\\r\\ncrying with thoughts of her husband at sea, and her little ones at the\\r\\ncottage at home.The hall was brilliantly lighted, and in the middle on the throne sat\\r\\nthe King and the young Queen. The musicians began to play, and then\\r\\nLucilla stepped forth on the platform and began to dance. She felt as\\r\\nlight as the sea foam, and when she swayed and curved to the sound of\\r\\nthe music, it seemed to her as if she heard only the swish of the waves\\r\\nas they beat upon the shore, and the murmur of the wind as it played\\r\\nwith the water, and she thought of her husband out at sea, with the\\r\\nwind blowing his ship along, and of her little babies living in the\\r\\ncottage on the beach.When she stopped, there was such a noise of applauding and cheering in\\r\\nthe hall, as had never been heard there before, and the King sent for\\r\\nher, and asked her where she came from, and who had taught her such\\r\\nwonderful steps, but she only answered that she was the daughter of a\\r\\npoor miller, who lived in a windmill, and she thought she must have\\r\\nlearnt to dance from watching the windmill’s sails go round. Every\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 16]\\r\\n\\r\\nnight the King would have her dance again and again, as he never tired\\r\\nof watching her, and every night Lucilla said to herself, “Now another\\r\\nnight is gone, and I am one day nearer to their taking me back to my\\r\\nown home and my children, with a bag of gold to give to my husband when\\r\\nhe comes back from sea.”The new Queen was a handsome woman, but she was very jealous, and it\\r\\nmade her angry that the King should admire the new dancer’s dancing so\\r\\nmuch, and she thought she would like to be able to dance like her. So\\r\\none evening when no one was watching her, she put on a big cloak that\\r\\ncovered her all over, and asked her way to where the dancer lived.\\r\\nLucilla sat alone in the little house that they had given her to live\\r\\nin, and the Queen came in behind her, and took off her cloak, and\\r\\nbade her be silent and not say her name, for fear some one should be\\r\\nlistening and know that she was there.“Now,” she said, “I have come to you that you may tell me, though no\\r\\none else knows it, who taught you to dance, that I may go and learn\\r\\nfrom them also to dance like you; for in the home that I come from, I\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 17]\\r\\n\\r\\nwas said to be the most graceful woman in the land and the best dancer,\\r\\nso that there is no dancing that I cannot learn.”Lucilla trembled, but she answered:“Your Majesty, I lived in a little windmill by the sea when I was a\\r\\nchild, far from teachers or dancers, but I watched the windmill sails\\r\\ngo round, morn, noon, and night; and perhaps it is that that taught me\\r\\nto dance as I do now. And if your Majesty wishes to learn to do what\\r\\nI do, I will gladly teach you all I know, and doubtless you will soon\\r\\nlearn to dance far better than I.”Upon this the Queen was delighted, and flung aside her cloak, and stood\\r\\nopposite to Lucilla, and begged her to begin to teach her at once, that\\r\\nshe might learn as soon as possible. All that evening they danced, but\\r\\nwhen the Queen thought she looked just as Lucilla did, she appeared to\\r\\nbe quite awkward and heavy beside her, and was dancing just as other\\r\\nmortals might. When she went away she was very much pleased, and said\\r\\nthat she would come twice more to learn from her, and then she was\\r\\nsure that she would be perfect. In her heart Lucilla was very much\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 18]\\r\\n\\r\\nfrightened, because she knew that the Queen did not dance as she did,\\r\\nand never could. However, the next night she came again, and the next\\r\\nagain, and then there was to be a grand court ball; and at this the\\r\\nQueen thought she would first show her husband how she could dance.\\r\\nThe King himself was fond of dancing, and danced well, although not\\r\\nhalf so well as Lucilla’s husband the sailor; and the Queen thought\\r\\nhow delighted he would be when he saw what a graceful wife he had got.\\r\\nAs the ball began, all the fine people were saying to each other, it\\r\\nreally seemed silly to dance after they had seen the wonderful new\\r\\ndancer, but the Queen smiled and thought to herself, “Now they will see\\r\\nthat I can do quite as well as she.” When her turn came she tripped\\r\\nlightly forward and danced as best she could, and thought it was just\\r\\nlike Lucilla, and the courtiers said among each other, “Our new Queen\\r\\ndances well,” but no one thought of saying that it was like Lucilla’s\\r\\ndancing, and the King said nothing at all on the matter; therefore the\\r\\nQueen felt herself growing hot and angry, and she turned red and white\\r\\nby turns.[Pg 19]“That lying wench has been tricking me,” she said to herself, “and\\r\\nshe has not taught me right at all; but I will punish her for her\\r\\ndeception, and soon she shall know what it is to deceive a Queen.”So the next day she went to her husband and said, “Husband, I have\\r\\nthought much of the new wonderful dancer whom we all admire so much,\\r\\nand truly I have never seen any one on earth who could dance as she\\r\\ncan; but now I think we should do well before she goes back to her own\\r\\nhome to know who has taught her her marvellous art, so that we may have\\r\\nour court dancers taught, that they may be there to please us when she\\r\\nis gone, for really there is nothing on earth that cannot be learnt if\\r\\nit is taught in the right way.”The King agreed, and they sent for Lucilla, and the King asked her to\\r\\ntell him where she had learnt her dancing, that they might summon the\\r\\nsame teachers to teach their court dancers. But Lucilla answered as\\r\\nbefore—she did not know—she thought she must have learnt dancing from\\r\\nwatching the windmill sails going round. At this the King became angry,\\r\\nand said, “That is nonsense, no one could learn dancing from looking\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 20]\\r\\n\\r\\nat windmill sails, neither was it possible that she, a poor miller’s\\r\\ndaughter, could have learnt such dancing by nature;” then he threatened\\r\\nher, that if she would not tell him the truth he should be obliged to\\r\\npunish her, and he said she should have a day to think of it in, but at\\r\\nthe end of the next day, he should expect her to tell him everything he\\r\\nwanted to know quite plainly.When she was gone away the King said to the Queen, “Wife, if this\\r\\ndancer persists in her silence, and will not tell us how she has\\r\\nlearnt, there is another thing which we must do. We must keep her here\\r\\nto dance for us as much as we choose, and not let her return at all to\\r\\nthe home from which she came.”The Queen was silent for a little, but she felt very jealous at the\\r\\nthought of the dancer remaining at the court, so she nodded her head\\r\\nand said, “Yes, but I think she ought to tell us more about it; for\\r\\nmyself, I begin to think that it is witchcraft, and perhaps she has\\r\\nbeen taught by the Evil One, and then we shouldn’t like her to remain\\r\\nhere and dance to us however beautiful it be, for who knows what ill\\r\\nluck it might not bring upon us?” Upon this the King looked grave, and\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 21]\\r\\n\\r\\nsaid he did not believe much in ill luck or good luck, but he should be\\r\\nloth to lose the dancer, so they had better settle to keep her if she\\r\\ndeclined to tell them how the other dancers were to be taught.Meantime Lucilla went back to her little house, and wept bitterly.\\r\\n“Would that I had never left my babes and my home,” she cried, “for I\\r\\ncannot break my word to the windfairies, and if I did they might do\\r\\nsome terrible harm to my little ones or to my husband at sea; yet if I\\r\\nrefuse to tell them they will most likely put me into prison, and there\\r\\nI shall remain for my life, and my husband and children will never\\r\\nknow what has become of me.” And she knelt down before the windows and\\r\\nlifted her arms and cried out, “Oh, dear windfairies, I have not broken\\r\\nfaith with you, so don’t break faith with me, and come to my help and\\r\\nsave me in my trouble.”Next evening Lucilla went again before the King, and he said to her,\\r\\n“Well, now will you tell us what we asked you last night, so that we\\r\\nmay send for your teachers, and have others taught to dance as you do?”[Pg 22]“My gracious liege,” answered Lucilla, “I can tell you nothing that I\\r\\nhave not told you before. Since I was a child I have danced as I dance\\r\\nnow, and I watched the sails of my father’s windmill, and I danced in\\r\\ntime to the waves, and perhaps that is what taught me to keep time and\\r\\nstep so well. I was dancing by the sea-shore when the travellers who\\r\\nbrought me here found me, and they promised me a bag of gold to take\\r\\nhome to my husband if I would come and dance at your Majesty’s court;\\r\\nand now you have seen me dance, and I have done all I can do, so I\\r\\nentreat you to give me the bag of gold, and let me go home again.”The King was silent, but the Queen was still more angry, and in her\\r\\nheart was determined that Lucilla should never return to her home until\\r\\nshe had found out about her dancing. So when they were alone she said\\r\\nto her husband, “It is now quite clear, it is by witchcraft that this\\r\\nwoman has learned, and we should do very wrong if we let her go till\\r\\nshe has confessed all.” So again they sent for Lucilla and ordered her\\r\\nto confess, and again she wept and declared that she could tell no\\r\\nmore. Then the King said, “Well, let us give the woman her bag of gold\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 23]\\r\\n\\r\\nand let her go,” but the Queen stopped him, and said, “No indeed, let\\r\\nus first try shutting her up in prison for a bit, and see if that won’t\\r\\nopen her lips.”At first the King refused, for he said that Lucilla had done no wrong,\\r\\nbut the Queen insisted that she was deceiving them, and that her\\r\\ndancing must be witchcraft, and at last the King began to listen to\\r\\nher. Also he was very angry with Lucilla for wanting to go home, and\\r\\nmuch disappointed to think he should see her dancing no more; so he\\r\\nconsented, and said that either she must tell him how it was she came\\r\\nto be able to dance better than anybody else in this world, and who\\r\\ntaught her, or else they should think her dancing witchcraft, and she\\r\\nmust go to prison and wait her punishment.Poor Lucilla wept most bitterly. “Alas!” cried she to herself, “woe is\\r\\nme, for I dare not break faith with the windfairies, and yet if I do\\r\\nnot, I shall never see my husband or my babies again, for I fear lest\\r\\nthey may put me to death here.”[Pg 24]However, she continued to be silent, and the King ordered her to be\\r\\nput into prison until she should speak out and tell them the truth;\\r\\nand the guards came and led her away to prison, and locked her into a\\r\\ndark cell. It was dreary and cold, and the walls were so thick that\\r\\nshe could not hear any of the noises from without, and there was only\\r\\none little window, which was too high up for her to see through. Here\\r\\nshe lay and lamented, and almost wished she could die at once, for she\\r\\nbelieved that they would burn her, or drown her, and bitterly did she\\r\\ngrieve that she had left her home and her children.Every day the King sent down to ask if she had changed her mind, but\\r\\nevery day she answered that she had nothing to say. One evening she sat\\r\\nin her dark cell alone, grieving as usual, when the prison door opened,\\r\\nand there entered a woman wrapped in a cloak and with her face hidden\\r\\nby a mask. When she took off the mask Lucilla saw it was the Queen, and\\r\\nshe sprang up hoping that she had come to tell her that she was to be\\r\\nreleased, but the Queen said, “Now I have come to you alone that you\\r\\nmay tell me the truth. Who taught you to dance, and where can I learn\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 25]\\r\\n\\r\\nto do what you do? If you will tell me I will ask the King to forgive\\r\\nyou, and you shall have your bag of gold, and go when you like.”Then poor Lucilla began to cry afresh, and said, “My gracious lady,\\r\\nI can tell you one thing that I have not yet told to any one, that\\r\\nis, that I did learn my dancing, but who told me, or how it was, is a\\r\\nsecret that I swore I would never tell to any one. And now I implore\\r\\nyour Royal Highness to let me go back to my fisherman husband, and my\\r\\nbabies. Alack! alack! it was an evil hour for me when I left my home.”Upon this the Queen became furious, but she hid her anger, and first\\r\\nshe tried to coax Lucilla to confess all, then she threatened her\\r\\nwith the King’s wrath, and then, as Lucilla still wept and said that\\r\\nshe could not break her promise, she started up in a rage, and said,\\r\\n“Indeed, it is of little use, however much you love your husband and\\r\\nyour children, for you will never see them again. The King has settled\\r\\nthat you shall be killed this very week, so now you know what you have\\r\\ngained by your wicked obstinacy.”[Pg 26]So the Queen returned to the King, and told him that the dancer had\\r\\nconfessed that she had learned her dancing, but she would not say from\\r\\nwhom, therefore it must be from the Evil One, and therefore there was\\r\\nnothing for it but that she should be killed. So they settled that\\r\\nfirst they would try to drown Lucilla, and if she were a witch she\\r\\nwould not sink, and the King gave orders that she should be taken out\\r\\nto sea next day and thrown overboard, and also that she should have\\r\\nheavy weights tied to her feet, and her arms should be bound to her\\r\\nsides.Next morning the guards fetched her, and they bound her arms to her\\r\\nsides, and tied heavy weights to her feet, and they took her down and\\r\\nplaced her in a boat on the sea-shore, and they rowed her out to sea,\\r\\nand all along the beach stood crowds of people, shouting and jeering,\\r\\nand calling out, “She is a witch! she is a witch! the King has done\\r\\nwell to have her killed.”“Alas! alas!” cried Lucilla, “what have I done to deserve this? surely\\r\\nI have done no wrong to be so cruelly treated. Dear windfairies, come\\r\\nto my help, for in truth now is the time of my direst need, and if you\\r\\ndesert me I am lost; but I pray you keep faith with me, as I have\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 27]\\r\\n\\r\\nkept faith with you.” Then, when they had rowed the boat out a little\\r\\nway, the guards seized her, and threw her into the water, and the salt\\r\\nwaves splashed over her face and through her hair; but in spite of the\\r\\nheavy weights on her feet she never sank, but felt as light as when she\\r\\ndanced with the waves on the sea-shore by her home, and she knew that\\r\\nthe windfairies held her up; and the waves rocked her gently, and drew\\r\\nher in towards the land, and laid her on the sand, and all the crowd\\r\\nyelled with rage.When they found that Lucilla could not be drowned both the King and\\r\\nQueen were very angry, and said that now it was quite clear that she\\r\\nwas a witch, and that she must be burnt, so they must take her back to\\r\\nprison, and arrange for her to be burnt in the market-place. So Lucilla\\r\\nwas again taken back to her little dark cell, and she kneeled on the\\r\\nground and looked up to the window, and murmured, “Thank you, dear\\r\\nwindfairies, you have kept faith with me, as I have kept faith with\\r\\nyou.”Then again the guards came, and took her by the arms and led her to\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 28]\\r\\n\\r\\nthe market-place, and here she saw a great pile of wood made, whereon\\r\\nshe was to be laid, and already men were busy setting fire to it.\\r\\nBut as Lucilla and the guards came to the spot, there arose a little\\r\\nbreeze, and it blew on to the faces of the crowd who went to see her\\r\\nburnt. The men who were trying to light the pile of wood, said they\\r\\ncould not make it catch for the wind; when at last it did catch fire,\\r\\nthe flames would not rise in the air, but were blown along the ground.\\r\\nStill they brought Lucilla up to the pile, and placed her upon it, and\\r\\nthen the flames divided on each side, and were blown away from her all\\r\\nround, so she sat in the midst quite unhurt.[Pg 29]\\nAt this the people all cried out, “Now we know that she really is a\\r\\nwitch, since she will not drown and the fire will not burn her,” and\\r\\nthey ran to tell the King and the Queen that the dancing woman did not\\r\\nmind the fire, but sat in the midst of it unhurt. On hearing this the\\r\\nKing and Queen came down to the market-place together, and saw Lucilla\\r\\nsitting on the pile of wood, and the flames blown away from her on all\\r\\nsides, and causing a great hubbub; so they told the guards to take her\\r\\nback to prison and keep her there, till they could arrange for her to\\r\\nbe beheaded. And again Lucilla bent her head, and said, “Now I know,\\r\\ndear windfairies, that you will never desert me, and I have nothing to\\r\\nfear, for while I keep faith with you, you will keep faith with me.”[Pg 30]\\nBy now it was getting late in the day, and the King commanded that\\r\\nLucilla should not be executed till next day, and that the scaffold\\r\\nshould be erected in the market-place, on which the block should be\\r\\nput, so that all the crowd might see, and both he and the Queen would\\r\\nbe there. But in order to give her one last chance that every one might\\r\\nsee how fair they were, the King offered that if she would confess,\\r\\neven when she was upon the scaffold, who had taught her to dance, she\\r\\nshould be allowed to return whence she came, and take her bag of gold\\r\\nwith her, and therefore the bag of gold was placed on the scaffold so\\r\\nthat all the people might see, and the bag was so large that Lucilla\\r\\ncould scarcely lift it.That evening Lucilla felt no fear, and she would have slept calmly in\\r\\nher cell, but the wind was beginning to blow in all directions, and all\\r\\nround she heard it roaring, and the trees were bending and breaking\\r\\nin the gale. When the morning came, the King and Queen said to each\\r\\nother, “This is the morning when they should execute the dancer, but\\r\\nit will be hard to get her on to the scaffold with a gale like this\\r\\nblowing.” However, the guards came to Lucilla’s cell, and took her out\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 31]\\r\\n\\r\\nas before, and led her towards the market-place, though they had much\\r\\nado to get along, for the wind blew so hard that they could scarce keep\\r\\nupright in it. All along the coast the little boats were being blown in\\r\\nto shore, and there were big ships, which had been driven in, to take\\r\\nrefuge from the storm. But Lucilla felt no fear, only she looked up to\\r\\nthe wind, and in her heart she said, “Now, dear windfairies, help me\\r\\nfor the last time, and keep faith with me, as I have kept faith with\\r\\nyou.”Near the shore came a big ship with shining white sails, riding over\\r\\nthe crested waves, and although all the other boats seemed troubled by\\r\\nthe wind, and some were dismasted and others were wrecked, this boat\\r\\nseemed no way hurt by it, and the people who saw it called out, “What\\r\\na gallant ship it was, and how brave the captain must be, who knew\\r\\nso well how to manage wind and water.” But when they knew that the\\r\\ntime had come for Lucilla to be beheaded, the people did not trouble\\r\\nfurther about the boats, and in spite of the gale they flocked to the\\r\\nmarket-place, and crowded round the scaffold on which was the block.[Pg 32]Then the guards and Lucilla mounted the scaffold, and Lucilla began to\\r\\nfear that at last the windfairies had forsaken her, and she wept and\\r\\nheld out her arms, and cried out, “Oh, dear windfairies, indeed I have\\r\\nkept my faith with you, surely, surely you will keep yours with me.”\\r\\nIn spite of the terrible gale, the King and the Queen came down to the\\r\\nmarket-place, though they could scarce see or hear for the wind, though\\r\\nall the time the sun was shining and the sky was blue. Then the guards\\r\\nbid Lucilla kneel down and place her head upon the block, and the bag\\r\\nof gold was beside her, and they said, “This is your last chance, speak\\r\\nnow and confess the truth to the King, and here is your gold, and you\\r\\nshall go.” And Lucilla answered as before, “I have spoken the truth,\\r\\nand there is no more that I can tell, since I have sworn never to say\\r\\nfrom whom I learnt my dancing.”Then the executioner lifted the axe in the air, but before it fell,\\r\\nthere came a sudden roar of wind, and the axe was swept from his hand,\\r\\nand the houses in the market-place tottered and fell, and high up\\r\\non the hill the palace was a mass of ruins. Only Lucilla knelt upon\\r\\nthe scaffold unhurt, for the King and the Queen and all the people\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 33]\\r\\n\\r\\nwere blown right and left, amidst the ruins of the houses, and no one\\r\\nthought of anything save how they could save themselves.Then Lucilla lifted her head and looked out to sea, and saw the big\\r\\nship coming in, and she heard the sailors cry, “Heyday, these poor folk\\r\\nare in a sad plight, we had better go and help them,” and they all\\r\\ntrooped up into the market-place, and the wind troubled them no more\\r\\nthan it had troubled their ship. But when Lucilla looked at them, the\\r\\nfirst whom she saw was her husband, and she gave a great cry, and held\\r\\nout her arms, and called out, “Now, dear windfairies, do I indeed know\\r\\nthat you have kept faith with me, and saved me in my direst hour of\\r\\nneed.”Then she told her husband all that had happened, and showed him the\\r\\nbag of gold, and prayed him take her back to her little cottage and\\r\\nher babies by the sea; and she knew that it was the windfairies that\\r\\nhad brought her husband to her, for he told her that whatever way they\\r\\nsteered the ship it would only take one course, and the wind had blown\\r\\nit without their guidance straight\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 34]\\r\\n\\r\\nto the town where she was to be killed.So Lucilla and her husband took the bag of gold, and went back to the\\r\\nlittle cottage by the sea-shore, and her father and her babies, and the\\r\\nKing and the Queen and all the rest of the people were left to build up\\r\\ntheir town as best they could, and Lucilla never saw nor heard of them\\r\\nany more, but lived happily with her husband for the rest of her life.[Pg 35]\\nOnce upon a time\\r\\nthere lived a young girl called Kesta who was the dairy-maid at a large\\r\\nfarm. She milked the cows and made the cheese and butter, and sometimes\\r\\ntook them into the town to sell for her master.On the farm worked a man named Adam. He drove in the cows for Kesta to\\r\\nmilk and watched her milking them. As she was a comely-looking girl and\\r\\ndid her work well, he thought she would make him a good wife; so one\\r\\nday he said, “Kesta, how would you like to marry me? and then we can\\r\\nsave our money and some day buy a farm for ourselves, and I should be\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 36]\\r\\n\\r\\na farmer and you should be the farmer’s wife, and have servants to wait\\r\\non you.”“That I should like very much,” said Kesta, “but I can’t say yes, at\\r\\nonce. To-morrow I am going to town with my cheeses, when I come back I\\r\\nwill give you an answer.”At night Kesta looked into her glass and said, “I wonder why Adam\\r\\nwishes to marry me? but as he does, most likely some better man would\\r\\nlike to do so; it would be folly to marry him till I see if I can’t do\\r\\nbetter. I must look about me when I go to town to-morrow, and see who I\\r\\ncan meet.”In the morning she dressed herself with great care in her best clothes,\\r\\nand set out for the town with the cheeses in a basket under her arm.\\r\\nWhen she had got a little way she passed a mill, and the miller all\\r\\nwhite with flour stood in the yard directing his men. He was an oldish\\r\\nman, and his wife was recently dead, and Kesta thought as she drew\\r\\nnear, it would be a better thing to marry him than to marry poor Adam,\\r\\nso she said, “Good-day, would you kindly let me rest a little?”[Pg 37]“Certainly, my girl,” said the miller, “you seem to be out of breath?”“And well I may be,” said Kesta, “such a run as I have had. I’ve come\\r\\nfrom the farm yonder, and it was as much as I could do to get away, for\\r\\nthe farmer’s man was very angry because I would not marry him, and of\\r\\ncourse I am too good for him, a pretty girl like me.”“Are you really a pretty girl?” said the miller; “let me see, perhaps\\r\\nyou are. Well, if you are too good for the farmer’s man perhaps\\r\\nyou would suit me. How would you like to marry me, and live in the\\r\\nmill-house yonder?”“I think I should like it well,” said Kesta, “but I have some business\\r\\nin the town, and must go there first, so I’ll stop here and tell you as\\r\\nI come back.” So she said good-bye, and went on her way feeling very\\r\\nmerry.“It would be much better to marry the miller than to marry Adam, but\\r\\nwho knows if I may not do better than either, so I must not be in any\\r\\nhurry.” So she walked on, and near to the town she met a man on a white\\r\\nhorse, and saw it was the bailiff of the great Duke at the Palace. “Who\\r\\nknows but that he may want a wife?” she said to herself, “I can but\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 38]\\r\\n\\r\\ntry.” So she sat down by the road-side and called out, “Ah me, what a\\r\\nthing it is to be a poor girl who has to run away from all the men she\\r\\nmeets!”“Why,” cried the bailiff, stopping his horse. “Why have you to run? who\\r\\ntries to hurt you?”“No one tries to hurt me,” said Kesta, “but I have to run from men who\\r\\nwant to marry me, because I am so pretty. At first it was a man at our\\r\\nfarm, and now it is the miller, who would not let me pass his door\\r\\nunless I promised to come back and marry him, but I am far too good for\\r\\nsuch as he.”“Is this really so?” cried the bailiff, who hated the miller; “did the\\r\\nmiller really want to marry you? If you’re too good to marry him, it\\r\\nmay be you would suit me.”“Indeed,” said Kesta, “I think that might do well, for I should live\\r\\nin a nice house and have plenty of servants. But I have to go into the\\r\\ntown on business, and you’re sure to be somewhere about here, and when\\r\\nI come back we will arrange it.” So she set off, leaving the bailiff\\r\\nchuckling at the thought of how angry the miller would be if he married\\r\\nKesta.[Pg 39]On went Kesta in high good-humour. “Now am I indeed doing well,” said\\r\\nshe; “how clever I was not to marry Adam before I came to town.”\\r\\nPresently she reached the town, and in the high street she passed the\\r\\nbank, and the banker himself stood in the doorway. He was fat and ugly\\r\\nand old, but his hands were covered with rings, and Kesta knew his\\r\\npockets were full of gold. Kesta said, “It would be a fine thing to\\r\\nmarry him, and I could hold up my head with any one. I think I’ll speak\\r\\nto him, as it would be folly to pass him without trying.” So she gave a\\r\\nloud sigh and said, “Alack a day, how hard is my lot!”“Why, what is wrong, my pretty lass?” said the banker.“Pretty you may well say,” answered Kesta. “Would I were not so, for\\r\\nthence come all my troubles.”“And what are they?” asked the banker.“Only wherever I go, I have no peace, for all the men want to marry me.\\r\\nFirst it is the farmer, then the miller, and lastly the duke’s bailiff,\\r\\nwho would scarcely let me pass on the road till I had promised him; and\\r\\nof course it is impossible, and I am much too pretty for any of them.”[Pg 40]“Is this really true?” cried the banker; “if so, there must be\\r\\nsomething very superior about you. Perhaps you would be good enough for\\r\\nme. How would you like to be my wife, and ride in a fine carriage, and\\r\\nwear silk gowns all day?”“Nay, that would be much more fitting,” cried Kesta, “and from the\\r\\nfirst I thought you would be much more suitable to be my husband than\\r\\nany of the others I have met; but I must go down the town first, so I\\r\\nwill come in here on my way back.” So she went on till she came to a\\r\\ngreat square in front of the barracks where the soldiers were drilling,\\r\\nwith their helmets and swords glittering in the sun, and at their head\\r\\nrode the General of the army. His voice was hoarse with shouting at his\\r\\nmen, and he swore dreadfully, but he was covered with gold, and looked\\r\\nvery grand. “Now supposing he has no wife,” thought Kesta, “it would be\\r\\na really fine thing to marry him: I can but try.” So she waited till\\r\\nthe soldiers were marching into the barracks, and then, when he was\\r\\nriding away, she went so close under the horse’s feet that he shouted\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 41]\\r\\n\\r\\nto her in case she should be run over. “Alas! what a life is mine,” she\\r\\ncried very loud that he might hear, “hunted here and there till I don’t\\r\\nknow where I go!”“Why, who hunts you?” cried the General angrily; “what nonsense you\\r\\ntalk, my good girl.”“How dare you say I talk nonsense,” cried Kesta, “when it is as much as\\r\\nI can do to get through your town for the men who want me to stop and\\r\\nmarry them!”“And why do they want you to marry them?” asked the General.“Because I’m so pretty, of course,” said Kesta promptly, and she took\\r\\noff her hat and looked up at the General.“I don’t think you are so pretty,” he said.“But I am,” cried Kesta angrily, “and it’s only stupid people who don’t\\r\\nsee it. Go and ask the men in the town. First it was a man at the farm,\\r\\nthen the miller, then the duke’s bailiff, then the banker—they all\\r\\nwanted to marry me, and I am much too good for any of them!”“If this is all true,” said the General, “of course you must be\\r\\nexceedingly pretty, and as you say you are much too good for them,\\r\\nperhaps you might suit me. How would you like that?”[Pg 42]“That might be better,” said Kesta, “and as you wish it very much I\\r\\nwill agree, and I hope you will try to make me a good husband; but I am\\r\\nobliged to go a little further on important business, and I will meet\\r\\nyou here on my way back,” and on she went laughing to herself. “Indeed\\r\\nI am fortunate,” thought she; “and as they all seem willing to marry\\r\\nme why should I not try higher, and see what the Duke himself would\\r\\nsay? There is nothing like being practical, and it would be downright\\r\\nsilly not to speak to the Duke now I am here.” By this time she had\\r\\ncome to the Duke’s palace, so she stopped a servant who was coming out\\r\\nand asked if he were at home, for she said, “I have special business\\r\\nwith him.” “He is sitting by the stream in the garden, where he sits\\r\\nfishing all day, and you can go and speak to him if you choose,” said\\r\\nthe servant. So Kesta went through the courtyard into the garden, and\\r\\nstraight on to where the Duke sat beside the stream with a long rod in\\r\\nhis hand fishing. He was dressed all in green, and seemed to be half\\r\\nasleep, and Kesta came quite near him before he saw her. Then she\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 43]\\r\\n\\r\\nsaid, “Ah, pity me, your Grace, and listen to my sad story.”“Good gracious! who are you?—don’t you know I am the Duke?” said he.“And that is why I have come to you to ask you to protect me from all\\r\\nthe men who pursue me,” said Kesta.“Why do they pursue you?” asked the Duke.“Because I am so pretty,” replied Kesta. “They all want to marry me:\\r\\nfirst the man at the farm, then the miller I met on the road, then your\\r\\nbailiff, then the banker, then the General of your army, and he would\\r\\nonly let me go when I promised to go back to him.”“The General!” said the Duke. “Is this true? does he really want to\\r\\nmarry you?”“Of course he does,” said Kesta; “if you doubt what I say you had\\r\\nbetter send to the town and ask.”“Indeed,” said the Duke, “I should not have thought you so very pretty,\\r\\nbut if what you say is true you must be. I’m not sure if it would not\\r\\nsuit me to marry you myself; but mind, I shall be exceedingly angry if\\r\\nI find you have not told me the truth, and they did not want to marry\\r\\nyou. Of course you would be delighted to marry me and be the Duchess?”[Pg 44]“Aye, that I should,” cried Kesta, and she grinned with delight.Then the Duke took from his side a horn and blew it loudly. There came\\r\\nfrom the palace four pages, dressed in blue and gold, who stood in a\\r\\nrow to receive his orders. “See,” cried the Duke, “I am going to marry\\r\\nthis lady, who everybody thinks is very beautiful, so see that you\\r\\ntreat her with respect; and go to the palace and bid them to prepare a\\r\\nfeast and fitting clothes for the bride, and tell the chaplain to be\\r\\nready, for I mean to marry her at once.”“And now,” he said to Kesta, when all his pages had returned to the\\r\\npalace, “come and sit by me and watch me fish till all is ready.”So Kesta sat by his side and watched him fishing with his long rod, but\\r\\nafter a time she grew tired of being silent, and said, “What have you\\r\\ncaught?”“Nothing yet,” said the Duke.“Then why do you go on?” asked she.“Because I’m sure to catch something soon, and it’s amusing. Wouldn’t\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 45]\\r\\n\\r\\nyou like to hold the rod a little?”“Yes, very much,” answered Kesta, who was afraid of offending him. So\\r\\nshe put out her hand to take the rod, and as she did so the basket fell\\r\\nfrom her arm and the cheeses rolled out.“What are those round balls?” asked the Duke, “and what an odd smell\\r\\nthey have.”“They are my cheeses,” cried Kesta; “I made them yesterday, and was\\r\\ntaking them to sell, when——”“Good gracious, you made them!” cried the Duke with a scream. “Then\\r\\nyou must be a common dairy-maid, and your hands are quite rough.\\r\\nHow terrible! And I was just going to marry you. How dare you think\\r\\nyourself good enough to marry me!” and he sprang to his feet in a\\r\\ntowering passion, and seizing his horn blew it so loudly that the four\\r\\npages ran up in great alarm. “Hunt her away,” cried the Duke, “she is\\r\\nan impostor—a common farm wench and makes cheeses. She thought herself\\r\\ngood enough to be the Duchess!”Away flew Kesta, with the pages after her hooting and shouting, “Down\\r\\nwith the impertinent hussy who wanted to marry the Duke, a common\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 46]\\r\\n\\r\\ndairy-maid who makes cheeses.”On rushed Kesta till she came to the General’s house, and at his window\\r\\nhe sat in his fine uniform. He sat waiting for her, but when he saw the\\r\\npages behind her he called, “Hey-dey, what is all this fuss about?”“It is nothing,” said Kesta. “See, I have come back to marry you as I\\r\\npromised.”But here the pages shouted, “Away with the impertinent dairy-maid, who\\r\\nthought herself good enough to marry the Duke.”“And wouldn’t the Duke marry her?” asked the General.“Of course not; she is nothing but a farm wench,” cried the pages, “and\\r\\nshe is to be chased from the town for her impertinence.”“And so she shall,” cried the General; “she thought she was fit for me\\r\\ntoo—it is disgraceful!” and he cried to some soldiers who stood by his\\r\\ndoor, “Here, my men, help to chase this good-for-nothing hussy out of\\r\\nthe town.”But before he had finished Kesta was running down the street with all\\r\\nher might to the banker’s. At last she came to the banker’s big square\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 47]\\r\\n\\r\\nhouse standing beside the bank, and on the steps was the banker himself\\r\\nin his shiny black clothes with gold rings on his hands.“Here I am,” cried Kesta; “and let me in quickly, for I am out of\\r\\nbreath with running.”“Why have you hurried so?” cried the banker, and as he spoke the pages\\r\\nand the soldiers came round the corner, “and what is all this shouting\\r\\nfor?”“Nay, how should I know?” cried Kesta, running into the house.But up came her pursuers, crying, “Away with her! down with her!”“Who is it you are calling after?” asked the banker.“That wench in the yellow dress who has gone into your house.”“Why, what has she done?” he asked.“Why, she thought herself good enough to marry the Duke and the\\r\\nGeneral, and she is to be hooted out of the town for her impudence!”“But didn’t the General want to marry her?” asked the banker.“Our General!” cried the soldiers angrily; “why, she’s only a\\r\\ndairy-maid, and not fit for him.”[Pg 48]“Then I’m sure she can’t be good enough for me, for I’m quite as good\\r\\nas he,” said the banker, and he ran into the house in a great rage,\\r\\ncrying, “Begone, you impertinent jade! how dare you think yourself good\\r\\nenough for me to marry!” It chanced at this moment that the clerks were\\r\\ncoming out of the bank next door, and when he saw them he cried, “Here,\\r\\nmy good fellows, help to chase this minx from the town; she wishes to\\r\\nbe my wife, when she is nothing but a common dairy-maid.” On this the\\r\\nclerks burst out laughing, and one and all ran after Kesta, who ran\\r\\nwith all her might and main.“It’s too hard,” sobbed she; “what have I done to be treated like\\r\\nthis?” But run as fast as she might she could not reach the bailiff’s\\r\\nhouse before them, and the pages, soldiers, and clerks were all close\\r\\nto her, shouting and laughing.“Why, what’s the matter?” cried the bailiff, “and why are you shouting\\r\\nat this poor maid?”“Why,” said they, “she wanted to marry first the Duke, and the General,\\r\\nand the banker, and of course they would not have her, because she is\\r\\nonly a common dairy wench.”“What impertinence!” cried the bailiff; “and, now I come to think of\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 49]\\r\\n\\r\\nit, she asked to marry me too; indeed she merits punishment for such\\r\\nbehaviour,” and seeing some of his farm people close at hand, he bid\\r\\nthem run after Kesta and drive her out of the town. But this time she\\r\\nhad started first, and had got on to the mill before they could reach\\r\\nher, and she ran into the garden where the miller was. “Well, I’m glad\\r\\nto see you back,” said he, “but how hard you have run.”“I was in such a hurry to get back. Now let’s go into the house,” she\\r\\nsaid.“Come along,” said the miller; “but what are all those people shouting\\r\\nfor?”“’Tis only the farmers bringing home pigs from the market,” said Kesta,\\r\\nbut she felt frightened, for she heard the people calling after her.“Pigs don’t make a noise like that,” said the miller, “I will go and\\r\\nsee what it is about.” And when he heard that they were all shouting\\r\\nat Kesta, he flew into a violent rage and cried, “If she wasn’t good\\r\\nenough for the bailiff I’m sure she’s not fit for me,” and he called\\r\\nto some of his men who were working at the mill, “See there, my men,\\r\\ndo you see that girl? throw some flour at her, for she is an impudent\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 50]\\r\\n\\r\\nhussy, and asked me to marry her.”Away flew Kesta again, and after her came all the crowd in a long line.\\r\\n“How unfortunate I am,” she sobbed; “but anyhow I can go back to Adam;\\r\\nhe’s sure to be glad to have me,” and on she sped, and at last she came\\r\\nto the farm and ran in, calling to Adam.“Is that you, Kesta?” cried Adam, coming to meet her, and kissing her.\\r\\n“I’m glad to see you, but why are you so hot?”“It is the sun, it was so strong,” said Kesta.“Then sit down and grow cool,” said Adam. “But I wonder what all that\\r\\nshouting outside can be?”“It is only people making holiday,” cried Kesta. But for all she could\\r\\nsay Adam went out to ask the people what they wanted at the farm?“We want nothing at the farm,” they cried, “but we followed that\\r\\nimpudent wench dressed in yellow.”“Why, what has she done?” asked Adam.“Done!” they cried. “Why, she came up to the town and asked to marry\\r\\nthe miller, and the banker, and the bailiff, and the General, and even\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 51]\\r\\n\\r\\nthe Duke himself, so she deserves to be punished for her presumption.”Then Adam looked very grave, and went back to the farm and said,\\r\\n“Indeed, Kesta, I cannot marry you now, since you’ve been to the town\\r\\nand tried to get a finer husband than me,” and he went back to his\\r\\nwork, and left Kesta sitting all alone; and there she sat and cried\\r\\nby herself, and did not get any husband after all, because she was so\\r\\nfalse and vain.[Pg 52]Once there was\\r\\na tree standing in the middle of a vast wilderness, and beneath the\\r\\nshade of its branches was a little pool, over which they bent. The pool\\r\\nlooked up at the tree and the tree looked down at the pool, and the\\r\\ntwo loved each other better than anything else on earth. And neither\\r\\nof them thought of anything else but each other, or cared who came and\\r\\nwent in the world around them.“But for you and the shade you give me I should have been dried up by\\r\\nthe sun long ago,” said the pool.[Pg 53]“And if it were not for you and your shining face, I should never have\\r\\nseen myself, or have known what my boughs and blossoms were like,”\\r\\nanswered the tree.Every year when the leaves and flowers had died away from the branches\\r\\nof the tree, and the cold winter came, the little pool froze over and\\r\\nremained hard and silent till the spring; but directly the sun’s rays\\r\\nthawed it, it again sparkled and danced as the wind blew upon it,\\r\\nand it began to watch its beloved friend, to see the buds and leaves\\r\\nreappear, and together they counted the leaves and blossoms as they\\r\\ncame forth.One day there rode over the moorland a couple of travellers in search\\r\\nof rare plants and flowers. At first they did not look at the tree, but\\r\\nas they were hot and tired they got off their horses, and sat under the\\r\\nshade of the boughs, and talked of what they had been doing. “We have\\r\\nnot found much,” said one gloomily; “it seemed scarcely worth while to\\r\\ncome so far for so little.”“One may hunt for many years before one finds anything very rare,”\\r\\nanswered the elder traveller. “Well, we have not done, and who knows\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 54]\\r\\n\\r\\nbut what we may yet have some luck?” As he spoke he picked up one of\\r\\nthe fallen leaves of the tree which lay beside him, and at once he\\r\\nsprang to his feet, and pulled down one of the branches to examine it.\\r\\nThen he called to his comrade to get up, and he also closely examined\\r\\nthe leaves and blossoms, and they talked together eagerly, and at\\r\\nlength declared that this was the best thing they had found in all\\r\\ntheir travels. But neither the pool nor the tree heeded them, for the\\r\\npool lay looking lovingly up to the tree, and the tree gazed down at\\r\\nthe clear water of the pool, and they wanted nothing more, and by and\\r\\nby the travellers mounted their horses and rode away.The summer passed and the cold winds of autumn blew.“Soon your leaves will drop and you will fall asleep for the winter,\\r\\nand we must bid each other good-bye,” said the pool.“And you too when the frost comes will be numbed to ice,” answered the\\r\\ntree; “but never mind, the spring will follow, and the sun will wake us\\r\\nboth.”[Pg 55]But long before the winter had set in, ere yet the last leaf had\\r\\nfallen, there came across the prairie a number of men riding on horses\\r\\nand mules, bringing with them a long waggon. They rode straight to the\\r\\ntree, and foremost among them were the two travellers who had been\\r\\nthere before.“Why do they come? What do they want?” cried the pool uneasily; but\\r\\nthe tree feared nothing. The men had spades and pickaxes, and began to\\r\\ndig a deep ditch all round the tree’s roots, and then they dug beneath\\r\\nthem, and at last both the pool and the tree saw that they were going\\r\\nto dig it up.“What are you doing? Why are you trying to wrench up my roots and to\\r\\nmove me?” cried the tree; “don’t you know that I shall die if you drag\\r\\nme from my pool which has fed and loved me all my life?” And the pool\\r\\nsaid, “Oh, what can they want? Why do they take you? The sun will come\\r\\nand dry me up without your shade, and I never, never shall see you\\r\\nagain.” But the men heard nothing, and continued to dig at the root of\\r\\nthe tree till they had loosened all the earth round it, and then they\\r\\nlifted it and wrapped big cloths round it and put it on their waggon\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 56]\\r\\n\\r\\nand drove away with it.Then for the first time the pool looked straight up at the sky without\\r\\nseeing the delicate tracery made by the leaves and twigs against the\\r\\nblue, and it called out to all things near it: “My tree, my tree, where\\r\\nhave they taken my tree? When the hot sun comes it will dry me up, if\\r\\nit shines down on me without the shade of my tree.” And so loudly it\\r\\nmourned and lamented that the birds flying past heard it, and at last\\r\\na swallow paused on the wing, and hovering near its surface, asked why\\r\\nit grieved so bitterly. “They have taken my tree,” cried the pool, “and\\r\\nI don’t know where it is; I cannot move or look to right or left, so I\\r\\nshall never see it again.”“Ask the moon,” said the swallow. “The moon sees everywhere, and she\\r\\nwill tell you. I am flying away to warmer countries, for the winter\\r\\nwill soon be here. Good-bye, poor pool.”At night, when the moon rose, and the pool looked up and saw its\\r\\nbeautiful white face, it remembered the swallow’s words, and called out\\r\\nto ask its aid.“Find me my tree,” it prayed; “you shone through its branches and know\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 57]\\r\\n\\r\\nit well, and you can see all over the world; look for my tree, and tell\\r\\nme where they have taken it. Perhaps they have torn it in pieces or\\r\\nburnt it up.”“Nay,” cried the moon, “they have done neither, for I saw it a few\\r\\nhours ago when I shone near it. They have taken it many miles away and\\r\\nit is planted in a big garden, but it has not taken root in the earth,\\r\\nand its foliage is fading. The men who took it prize it heartily, and\\r\\nstrangers come from far and near to look at it, because they say it is\\r\\nso rare, and there are only one or two like it in the world.”On hearing this the pool felt itself swell with pride that the tree\\r\\nshould be so much admired; but then it cried in anguish, “And I shall\\r\\nnever see it again, for I can never move from here.”“That is nonsense,” cried a little cloud that was sailing near; “I was\\r\\nonce in the earth like you. To-morrow, if the sun shines brightly, he\\r\\nwill draw you up into the sky, and you can sail along till you find\\r\\nyour tree.”“Is that true?” cried the pool, and all that night it rested in peace\\r\\nwaiting for the sun to rise. Next day there were no clouds, and when\\r\\nthe pool saw the sun shining it cried, “Draw me up into the sky, dear\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 58]\\r\\n\\r\\nSun, that I may be a little cloud and sail all the world over, till I\\r\\ncan find my beloved tree.”When the sun heard it, he threw down hundreds of tiny golden threads\\r\\nwhich dropped over the pool, and slowly and gradually it began to\\r\\nchange and grow thinner and lighter, and to rise through the air, till\\r\\nat last it had quite left the earth, and where it had lain before,\\r\\nthere was nothing but a dry hole, but the pool itself was transformed\\r\\ninto a tiny cloud, and was sailing above in the blue sky in the\\r\\nsunshine. There were many other little clouds in the sky, but our\\r\\nlittle cloud kept apart from them all. It could see far and near over a\\r\\ngreat space of country, but nowhere could it espy the tree, and again\\r\\nit turned to the sun for help. “Can you see?” it cried. “You who see\\r\\neverywhere, where is my tree?”“You can’t see it yet,” answered the sun, “for it is away on the other\\r\\nside of the world, but presently the wind will begin to blow and it\\r\\nwill blow you till you find it.”Then the wind arose, and the cloud sailed along swiftly, looking\\r\\neverywhere as it went for the tree. It could have had a merry time if\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 59]\\r\\n\\r\\nit had not longed so for its friend. Everywhere was the golden sunlight\\r\\nshining through the bright blue sky, and the other clouds tumbled and\\r\\ndanced in the wind and laughed for joy.“Why do you not come and dance with us?” they cried; “why do you sail\\r\\non so rapidly?”“I cannot stay, I am seeking a lost friend,” answered the cloud, and\\r\\nit scudded past them, leaving them to roll over and over, and tumble\\r\\nabout, and change their shapes, and divide and separate, and play a\\r\\nthousand pranks.For many hundred miles the wind blew the little cloud, then it said,\\r\\n“Now I am tired and shall take you no further, but soon the west wind\\r\\nwill come and it will take you on; good-bye.” And at once the wind\\r\\nstopped blowing and dropped to rest on the earth; and the cloud stood\\r\\nstill in the sky and looked all around.“I shall never find it,” it sighed. “It will be dead before I come.”Presently the sun went down and the moon rose, then the west wind began\\r\\nto blow gently and moved the cloud slowly along.[Pg 60]“Which way should I go, where is it?” entreated the cloud.“I know; I will take you straight to it,” said the west wind. “The\\r\\nnorth wind has told me. I blew by the tree to-day; it was drooping, but\\r\\nwhen I told it that you had risen to the sky and were seeking it, it\\r\\nrevived and tried to lift its branches. They have planted it in a great\\r\\ngarden, and there are railings round it and no one may touch it; and\\r\\nthere is one gardener who has nothing to do but to attend to it, and\\r\\npeople come from far and near to look at it because it is so rare, and\\r\\nthey have only found one or two others like it, but it longs to be back\\r\\nin the desert, stooping over you and seeing its face in your water.”“Make haste, then,” cried the cloud, “lest before I reach it I fall to\\r\\npieces with joy at the thought of seeing it.”“How foolish you are!” said the wind. “Why should you give yourself up\\r\\nfor a tree? You might dance about in the sky for long yet, and then you\\r\\nmight drop into the sea and mix with the waves and rise again with them\\r\\nto the sky, but if you fall about the tree you will go straight into\\r\\nthe dark earth, and perhaps you will always\\r\\nremain there, for at the roots of the tree they have made a deep hole\\r\\nand the sun cannot draw you up through the earth under the branches.”[Pg 61-62][Pg 63]“Then that will be what I long for,” cried the cloud. “For then I can\\r\\nlie in the dark where no one may see me, but I shall be close to my\\r\\ntree, and I can touch its roots and feed them, and when the raindrops\\r\\nfall from its branches they will run down to me and tell me how they\\r\\nlook.”“You are foolish,” said the wind again; “but you shall have what you\\r\\nwant.”The wind blew the cloud low down near the earth till it found itself\\r\\nover a big garden, in which there were all sorts of trees and shrubs,\\r\\nand such soft green grass as the cloud had never seen before. And there\\r\\nin the middle of the grass, in a bed of earth to itself, with a railing\\r\\nround it so that no one could injure it, was the tree which the cloud\\r\\nhad come so far to seek. Its leaves were falling off, its branches were\\r\\ndrooping, and its buds dropped before they opened, and the poor tree\\r\\nlooked as if it were dying.“There is my tree, my tree!” called the cloud. “Blow me down, dear\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 64]\\r\\n\\r\\nwind, so that I may fall upon it.”The wind blew the cloud lower and lower, till it almost touched the top\\r\\nbranches of the tree. Then it broke and fell in a shower, and crept\\r\\ndown through the earth to its roots, and when it felt its drops the\\r\\ntree lifted up its leaves and rejoiced, for it knew that the pool it\\r\\nhad loved so had followed it.“Have you come at last?” it cried. “Then we need never be parted again.”In the morning when the gardeners came they found the tree looking\\r\\nquite fresh and well, and its leaves quite green and crisp. “The cool\\r\\nwind last night revived it,” they said, “and it looks as if it had\\r\\nrained too in the night, for round here the earth is quite damp.” But\\r\\nthey did not know that under the earth at the tree’s roots lay the\\r\\npool, and that that was what had saved the tree.And there it lies to this day, hidden away in the darkness where no\\r\\none can see it, but the tree feels it with its roots, and blooms in\\r\\nsplendour, and people come from far and near to admire it.[Pg 65]\\nOnce there lived a\\r\\nyoung girl called Nanina, who kept sheep for an old farmer. One day he\\r\\nsaid to her, “Nanina, I’m going away to buy pigs at a market far off,\\r\\nand I shall be away one whole month, so be sure and take good care of\\r\\nthe flock, and remember, there are six sheep and eight lambs, and I\\r\\nmust find them safe when I return. And mind,\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 66]\\r\\n\\r\\nNanina, that whatever you do, you don’t go near the old palace on the\\r\\nother side of the hill, for it is filled with wicked fairies who might\\r\\ndo you an ill turn.” Nanina promised, and her master started.The first day all went well, and she drove the flock in safely at\\r\\nnight; but the next day she found it dull sitting on the hillside\\r\\nwatching the lambs at play, and wondered why her master had told her\\r\\nalways to keep on that side, and away from the old palace on the other.“If it is filled with fairies,” quoth she, “it won’t hurt me just to\\r\\nlook at it; I should like to see a fairy.” So she drove her flock to\\r\\nthe other side of the hill, and sat looking at the old palace that was\\r\\nhalf in ruins, but was said to be lit up quite brightly every night\\r\\nafter it was dark.“I wonder if it really is lit up,” said Nanina, “I should like to see.”\\r\\nSo she waited on that side of the hill till the sun went down, and\\r\\nthen she saw a bright light appearing in one of the palace windows.\\r\\nAs she stood and watched, the front door opened, and out there came a\\r\\nshepherd boy followed by a flock of black goats. Nanina stared at him,\\r\\nfor she had never seen any one so beautiful before. He was dressed in\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 67]\\r\\n\\r\\nglittering green, and wore a soft brown hat trimmed with leaves under\\r\\nwhich his curls hung down. In one hand he held a crook and in the\\r\\nother a pipe, and as he drew near, he began to play the pipe and dance\\r\\nmerrily, while the goats behind him skipped and danced too. Nanina had\\r\\nnever seen such goats; they were jet black, with locks curling and\\r\\nthick and soft as silk. As she listened open-mouthed to the music of\\r\\nthe pipe, she heard it speak words in its playing:—The shepherd boy danced lightly to where she\\r\\nstood, and louder and louder sounded the pipe,\\r\\nand still it said—Nanina gaped to see the goats dance and spring\\r\\nin time to the music, and so cheering it was, that\\r\\nshe felt her own feet beginning to move with it.\\r\\nThe shepherd made her a low bow and offered\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 68]\\r\\n\\r\\nher his hand, and she placed hers in it, and off they\\r\\nstarted together. Nanina’s feet felt as light as\\r\\nif they had been made of cork, and she laughed\\r\\nwith glee as she bounded on; and as she danced\\r\\nwith the shepherd, so her flock began to move\\r\\ntoo, and thus they went, followed by the black\\r\\ngoats and sheep all skipping merrily. “If my\\r\\nflock follow me there can be no harm,” thought\\r\\nNanina, and on they kept in time to the wonderful\\r\\ntune—Whither they went she knew not, she thought of nothing but the joy of\\r\\ndancing to the wonderful music; but suddenly, just ere sunrise, the\\r\\nshepherd stopped, and dropped her hand and gave one long slow note on\\r\\nthe pipe, at which the goats gathered round him, and before she knew\\r\\nwhere they were going, they had disappeared into the palace. Then she\\r\\nwas in a terrible fright, for she saw the sun beginning to rise, and\\r\\nfound the whole night had passed, when she thought she had only been\\r\\nten minutes. She counted her sheep, and, alas! there was one lamb\\r\\nmissing.[Pg 69][Pg 70]She sought everywhere for it, but no trace of it was to be seen. Then\\r\\nshe drove all the others back to the farm and watched them, falling\\r\\nhalf asleep, for she was weary with the dancing. But when evening\\r\\ncame, and she had slept some time, she said to herself, “Surely the\\r\\nbest plan would be to go back to the old palace, and see if I can see\\r\\nthe shepherd and the black goats again.” So just about sunset she\\r\\nreturned to the palace, and again the door opened, and the beautiful\\r\\nshepherd boy came out with the black goats following. But when he began\\r\\nto play on his pipe, and the goats to dance, Nanina forgot all about\\r\\nthe lost lamb and danced with him as before. Again they danced till\\r\\nmorning, and then he left her suddenly, and she found that another lamb\\r\\nhad disappeared. Then she wept and lamented, and declared that the next\\r\\nnight she would only watch the shepherd and nothing would make her\\r\\ndance; and again the next night the same thing happened; when once she\\r\\nheard the pipe, Nanina could not keep still, and another lamb was lost.\\r\\nThis went on to the end of a fortnight, when there was only one of the\\r\\nflock left. Then she was terribly frightened, for her master would soon\\r\\nreturn, and she did not know what she should say to him. But still she\\r\\nwent back and sat by the old palace, and when the shepherd came out,\\r\\nand she heard the music, she could not refrain from dancing, and in\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 71]\\r\\n\\r\\nthe morning the last lamb had gone!All the day Nanina wandered about and cried, but no sheep were to be\\r\\nfound. At last, when she was quite weary, she sat down beneath a beech\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 72]\\r\\n\\r\\ntree near the palace, and leaned her head against its trunk sobbing.\\r\\nThen she saw that someone had torn down the lowest branches of the\\r\\ntree and they were hanging down broken. She raised them and tied them\\r\\nup, so that they would grow together, and as she did so she heard a\\r\\nshadowy voice whisper, “Thank you, Nanina; Nanina, don’t dance.” She\\r\\nlooked about but there was nobody there, and again she heard a whisper,\\r\\n“Nanina, don’t dance.” The voice came from the beech tree, and among\\r\\nthe leaves she saw a small twisted face looking at her. “Thank you,\\r\\nNanina, for saving my bough,” said the tree, “and if you mind me, you\\r\\nshall get all your sheep back again.”“My sheep,” cried Nanina. “Only tell me, and I will do anything.”“Then you must not dance. Every time you refuse to dance with the\\r\\nfairy, one of your flock will be returned.”“But how can I refuse to dance?” cried Nanina, “for as I hear the\\r\\npipe beginning, my feet begin to move of themselves, it is no use my\\r\\ntrying,” and she cried aloud.“Bury your feet in the earth like my roots,” whispered back the voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 73]\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dig a hole deep down, and I will hold your feet so that you shall not\\r\\nmove them, only you must bear the pain, and not mind if you walk lame\\r\\nafterwards, for I shall hold them very tight, and it will hurt you.”“Hurt me as you please,” cried Nanina, “and I shan’t mind. If only I\\r\\ncan get back my sheep I will bear any pain.” So she knelt beneath the\\r\\ntree, and dug a deep hole in the ground among its roots, and then she\\r\\nplaced her feet among the loose earth, and she felt something moving\\r\\nnear them which tightened around and drew them far down into the\\r\\nground, and held them as if they were bound with cords. She saw the\\r\\nlights in the windows of the palace, and the door opened. “Hold me,\\r\\nhold me fast,” she cried, “for when I hear the music I shall begin to\\r\\ndance.” The tree said nothing, but she felt its roots tightening so\\r\\nthat she could not move. The door of the palace opened as before, and\\r\\nthe beautiful shepherd, followed by his goats and her sheep, came out,\\r\\nand she heard once more the sound of the wonderful pipe, and he danced\\r\\nstraight up to the tree beneath which she stood, and held out his hand\\r\\nto her. Nanina felt as if her feet were beginning to move under the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 74]\\r\\n\\r\\nearth, but the roots of the tree held them so firmly that she could not\\r\\nstir one inch. Still the shepherd danced before her, and as she saw\\r\\nhim springing in front, with the flocks behind him following him, she\\r\\ngrew quite wild to dance, and tried her hardest to break her feet free\\r\\nfrom the roots which held them, but in vain, though she almost screamed\\r\\nwith the pain they cost her. For hours the shepherd danced in front\\r\\nof her, till, as before, the pipe sounded forth one long note, and he\\r\\ndisappeared, but this time not all the flock went with him, for beside\\r\\nher was left one of her own little lambs, and when she saw it she\\r\\ncried for joy. She felt the roots releasing their hold of her feet,\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 75]\\r\\n\\r\\nand she drew them out of the earth, and they were all blue and bruised\\r\\nwhere they had been held. She drove home the lamb and fastened it into\\r\\nthe sheep-pen, but her feet were so stiff and swelled that she limped\\r\\nas she walked. Next night she went back to the beech tree, and again\\r\\nslipped her feet into its roots, and felt them twist around them; but\\r\\nthis time the poor feet were so sore that she cried when they touched\\r\\nthem. Again the fairy appeared, and again she heard the pipe, and her\\r\\nlonging to dance was worse than ever, but the roots clutched her and\\r\\nwould not let her stir. When the pipe ceased and the fairy disappeared,\\r\\nanother of her lambs was left with her, and she drove it home as she\\r\\nhad done the first, but she had to go very slowly on account of her\\r\\ncrushed feet.The same thing happened the next night and the next, till all the flock\\r\\nhad returned save one, and Nanina’s feet were so bad that she could\\r\\nscarcely hobble, for they were crushed and bleeding, and she wondered\\r\\nwhether she would walk lame all the days of her life.On the last evening she limped down to the tree almost crying with\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 76]\\r\\n\\r\\npain. When she sat down by its trunk she heard the soft sighing voice\\r\\nsaying, “Never mind, Nanina; to-night is the last, and though it will\\r\\nhurt you the most, it will soon be past.” So she slipped her feet into\\r\\nthe earth once more, though she shrank as they touched it, and directly\\r\\nthe sun had set, the lights appeared in the palace windows, and out\\r\\ncame the shepherd with all his black goats and her one white sheep\\r\\nfollowing him. He looked more beautiful than ever, for he had a crown\\r\\nset with jewels, and was dressed in scarlet and gold, but when the pipe\\r\\nbegan to play it was not merry dance-music it made, but long sad notes,\\r\\nlike a funeral march; yet Nanina’s feet would have moved in spite of\\r\\nherself, and she would have marched in time to them, had not the roots\\r\\ntightened like cords and held her down. Tears of pain ran down her\\r\\ncheeks, and she sobbed, and instead of the joyous words what the music\\r\\nsaid was—[Pg 77-78][Pg 79]Presently the music grew quicker, and her longing to move with it\\r\\ngrew stronger. She swayed herself about, and cried and screamed as\\r\\nthe fairy and flock danced, now solemnly and slowly, now joyously and\\r\\nwildly. Just when she felt that she could bear it no longer there came\\r\\none long low note on the pipe, and with a mighty crash like thunder the\\r\\nshepherd and the goats disappeared, and not only had they gone, but the\\r\\nwalls of the old palace had fallen, and nothing was left of it but a\\r\\nheap of stones. Beside her on the grass was the last of her lost sheep.\\r\\n“Good-bye, Nanina,” said the voice from the beech tree; “now you have\\r\\nall your flock again,” and she felt the roots loosen round her feet,\\r\\nbut when she looked at them she found that her legs were wounded and\\r\\nbleeding, where she had dashed them about in trying to dance. She knelt\\r\\ndown and smoothed over the earth where it was torn up among the trees,\\r\\nand she put her arms round the trunk and kissed and thanked it for\\r\\nhaving helped her, but the voice did not speak again. Then she drove\\r\\nhome the last sheep, but she had to go on her hands and knees, for her\\r\\nfeet were too bad to walk.Next day when the farmer came home, he was well pleased that she had\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 80]\\r\\n\\r\\nkept his flock safe, but he would fain know how she had got such sore\\r\\nfeet that for long she must walk lame. “Of a truth, master,” she quoth,\\r\\n“it was in saving the lambs when they got into dangerous places.”Underneath the beech tree, where Nanina’s feet had bled among the\\r\\nearth, there sprang up pretty little scarlet flowers, and whenever\\r\\nshe passed and saw them she remembered how she had been punished for\\r\\ndisobeying her master, and made up her mind never to do so again.[Pg 81]\\nIn a little village there lived a young potter, who made his living by\\r\\nmaking all sorts of earthenware. He took the clay, and made it into\\r\\nshapes on the wheel, and then baked his cups and jars in a kiln. He\\r\\nmade big jugs and little jugs, and basins and cups and saucers, and\\r\\nindeed every sort of pot or jar that could be wanted. He was very\\r\\nfond of his work, and was always thinking of how to make new shapes,\\r\\nor colour his jars with pretty colours. It was a very tiny village\\r\\nhe lived in, and he worked at throwing his pots on his wheel by the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 82]\\r\\n\\r\\nroad-side, but people came from many other villages and towns to buy\\r\\nhis ware. Once a year there was a big fair, held in the town near, and\\r\\njust before it, the potter was always very busy making new pots and\\r\\njugs to sell there. A few nights before the fair was to be held, he was\\r\\nhard at work, trying to finish a number of little bowls, so he sat at\\r\\nhis wheel late in the evening after the sun was set. All day long the\\r\\nroad had been gay with folk coming to the fair, some were in carts,\\r\\nand some were on foot, and there were a number of gipsies in caravans,\\r\\nbringing all sorts of goods to sell. Most of them went through the\\r\\nvillage and on to a big common a little further on, where they got out\\r\\nof their carts and put up tents, to sleep in while the fair went on.\\r\\nThe potter was so busy with his little basins on his turning wheel\\r\\nthat he did not hear the sound of footsteps, and when he looked up, he\\r\\nwas surprised to see a young gipsy girl standing near, watching him.\\r\\nShe was quite young, and had big black eyes, and rosy round cheeks,\\r\\nand her black hair was twisted up in little red beads and chains. She\\r\\nwas dressed in some very gay stuff, and round her neck was a gold\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 83]\\r\\n\\r\\nnecklace, and on her fingers and arms were rings and bracelets.“That should be a fine cup,” said the girl, “since you keep your eyes\\r\\non it and can look at nothing else.”“I keep my eyes for my work, that I may do it well,” said the potter,\\r\\n“for I live by my work, and neither by stealing nor begging.”“But I fancy many others can do your work as well, or better than you,”\\r\\nanswered the gipsy. “What can your cups do when they are finished? I\\r\\ndon’t hear you say anything to them, so I should think they would be\\r\\nstupid cups—only fit to drink out of.”“And what else should they be for?” asked the potter angrily. “What do\\r\\nyou mean by saying that you don’t hear me saying anything to my cups?\\r\\nI don’t think you know what you are talking about. It is nonsense, and\\r\\nyou are talking nonsense.”“My grandfather used to make pots on a wheel,” said the gipsy, and she\\r\\nlaughed low, and showed her white teeth in the moonlight; “ah! but he\\r\\nknew how to do them, and he had charms to say to them when he threw\\r\\nthem. And one of his cups would make you wise if you drank out of it,\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 84]\\r\\n\\r\\nand another would give you your true love’s heart if she drank from it,\\r\\nand another would make you forget everything—yes, even your true love,\\r\\nand all your mirth and all your sorrow, and I think that was the best\\r\\ncup of all;” and again the gipsy laughed in the moonlight, and sang a\\r\\nlittle song to herself as she sat herself down before the potter.“Now this is real child’s talk,” said the potter very impatiently.\\r\\n“’Tis easy to say your grandfather knew how to do all this, but why\\r\\nshould I believe you? and because your grandfather may have been able\\r\\nto throw a bowl upon the wheel, that doesn’t make you know anything\\r\\nabout the craft, or how it is done.”“Nay, but he taught me too,” said the gipsy. “Give me a piece of your\\r\\nclay, and let me come to your wheel and you shall see.”At first the potter thought she was talking nonsense, but to his great\\r\\nsurprise she took hold of the clay in her little brown hands, and\\r\\nmoulded and modelled it with the greatest skill. Then she placed it on\\r\\nthe wheel and threw a little jug, and he wondered to see how deft she\\r\\nwas.[Pg 85]“Now I will make you a little bowl,” she said, and then she made jugs\\r\\nand pots and jars, far more quickly and skilfully than the potter could\\r\\nhave done. “And now I will colour them too,” she cried. “See, I shall\\r\\ncatch the colour from the moon, and to-morrow you can put them into\\r\\nyour kiln and bake them, and you may be sure that you have never had\\r\\nsuch pots there before.” Then she put her little brown hands out into\\r\\nthe moonlight, and they were covered with rings which glittered and\\r\\nshone, but as she held up her palms to the moon’s rays, it seemed to\\r\\nthe potter as if they too were full of some strange glittering liquid.\\r\\n“And now,” she said, “see, I will put it on to your pots, and I should\\r\\nthink I had taught you that I know more about your trade than you do\\r\\nyourself.” And she took the pots in her hands and rubbed her palms over\\r\\nthem, and she traced patterns on them with her fingers.The potter looked at her and felt almost angry, but she only laughed in\\r\\nhis face.“And now one last thing,” she cried, “and that is, that I will make\\r\\nyou a cup that has a spell in it, and it shall be a present for you\\r\\nto remember me by. It will be very plain, and there will be no gay\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 86]\\r\\n\\r\\ncolours in it, but when you give it to your true love to drink from,\\r\\nif once you have drunk from it yourself, you will have all her heart,\\r\\nbut beware that she doesn’t take a second draught. For though the first\\r\\ndraught that she drinks will be drunk to love, the second draught will\\r\\nbe drunk to hate, and though she have loved you more than all else on\\r\\nearth, all her love will turn to hate when she drinks again. And as you\\r\\nare so ignorant how to make bowls and cups, you will not know how to\\r\\nfashion one so as to win back her love again.”The potter stared in silence, while the gipsy took another bit of\\r\\nclay and placed it upon the wheel, and then she bent her head, which\\r\\nglittered with beads and coins, low over it, and placing her rosy lips\\r\\nclose to the mouth of the cup, sang some words into it, while she\\r\\nmoulded it with her hands, and turned the wheel with her foot. It was\\r\\nin some strange language that the potter had never heard before.“Good-bye,” she said presently. “Now, there, that is for you, and be\\r\\nsure you do not sell the little brown cup, but keep it and give it to\\r\\nyour true love to drink out of; but only one draught, for if there\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 87]\\r\\n\\r\\nare two maybe you will need the gipsy’s help again.” Then she laughed,\\r\\nand nodding her head over her shoulder, tripped lightly away in the\\r\\nmoonlight while the potter stared after her.At first he thought he had been asleep, but there around him stood the\\r\\nlittle rows of jugs and pots which the gipsy had made, and truly they\\r\\nwere beautifully done. He took them up, and turned them over in his\\r\\nhand, and wondered at their shape and workmanship.“To-morrow,” he said, “I will put them into the kiln, and see how they\\r\\ncome out. She certainly was a clever wench, and knew her work; but as\\r\\nfor her talk about having coloured them, that was all nonsense, and as\\r\\nfor breathing spells and charms into the cups, why it is like baby’s\\r\\ntalk.”But next day when the pots were baked, the potter was even more\\r\\nsurprised, for they had the most wonderful colours that he had ever\\r\\nseen: silver, blue, grey and yellow, in all sorts of patterns, all save\\r\\nthe little brown cup, which was the last the gipsy had made. But when\\r\\nhe looked at it the potter felt a little uncomfortable, and began to\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 88]\\r\\n\\r\\nwonder if it really did contain the charm as she had declared.When the fair began, the potter placed all the gipsy’s wares on a stall\\r\\nwith his own, and marked them with very high prices, but had he asked\\r\\nthree times as much he could have got it, for there were some rich folk\\r\\nfrom the big houses who came to the fair, and they at once bought them\\r\\nall up, declaring that such pots and jugs they had never seen. At this\\r\\nthe potter was well pleased, and found that he had made more money than\\r\\nhe had earned in many a long month past; but when people wanted him to\\r\\nmake them more like them, he was obliged to shake his head, and say,\\r\\n“That he was very sorry, but he had had them coloured from afar, and he\\r\\ndid not know where he could now have them done.” Of the gipsy he saw\\r\\nnothing more, though he looked for her everywhere during the three days\\r\\nin which the fair lasted, but she was not to be seen, and when the fair\\r\\nwas over, and the other people were packing their carts and vans to go\\r\\non their way, he saw very many gipsies, and supposed that she had gone\\r\\nwith some of them, without giving him the chance of speaking to her\\r\\nagain.[Pg 89]Years went by, and the potter never heard anything more of the gipsy,\\r\\nindeed he would have thought it had all been a dream if it had not been\\r\\nfor the little brown pot standing on the shelf. Sometimes he took it\\r\\nup, and looked at it, and wondered when he saw how well and cleverly it\\r\\nwas made. He still laughed when he remembered what the gipsy had said\\r\\nabout leaving a charm in it, for though he himself had drunk out of it\\r\\nmany times, he never thought it had brought any spell on him.One year when the fair was being held, the potter was at his place\\r\\nas usual with his stall covered with pots, and there came and placed\\r\\nherself beside him at the next stall a woman with some spinning-wheels.\\r\\nHer stall was covered with fine linen cloths woven in pretty patterns,\\r\\nand so fine and well wrought were they, that many people wanted\\r\\nto buy them. With her were her two daughters, and one sat at the\\r\\nspinning-wheel and spun the flax, and the other had a hand-loom and\\r\\nwove it when it was spun to show the good folk how the cloths were\\r\\nmade. Both were pretty girls, but the girl who had the hand-loom had\\r\\nthe sweetest face the potter had ever seen. Her eyes were very blue,\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 90]\\r\\n\\r\\nand her hair was like golden corn, and when she smiled, it was as if\\r\\nthe sun shone. The potter watched her as she sat weaving, and could\\r\\nnot keep his eyes from her or attend properly to his own pots, or to\\r\\nthe people who wanted to buy them. Every day he watched the young girl\\r\\nat her work, for the fair lasted for a week, and the more he looked at\\r\\nher the more he wanted to look, till at last he said to himself that\\r\\nsomehow or other he must get her for his wife; so when the fair was\\r\\ndone he begged her to marry him, and to remain with him, and he said he\\r\\nwould always work for her, and she should want for nothing. The mother\\r\\nwas a poor widow, and she and her daughters made their bread by going\\r\\nabout the country spinning and weaving, and she would have been quite\\r\\nwilling that the potter should marry her daughter, but the girl only\\r\\nlaughed, and said that she scarcely knew the potter, but when she came\\r\\nback again the next year to the fair, she would give him his answer. So\\r\\nthe widow and her two daughters went away, and no sign of them was left\\r\\nwith the potter, save a lock of golden hair, which he had begged from\\r\\nthe daughter.[Pg 91]The year passed away, but to the potter it seemed the longest year he\\r\\nhad ever lived. He pined for the time to come when the fair should\\r\\nbe held, and the widow and her daughters should return. As the time\\r\\ndrew near he got down the brown cup, and looked at it again and again.\\r\\n“Nay,” he said, “what harm could it do? the gipsy said it would give me\\r\\nmy true love’s heart if she drank out of it after I had drunk, and I\\r\\nhave drunk out of it many a time. I don’t believe it, but all the same\\r\\nit would be no harm for her to drink from it.”And so when the fair was opened, he took the brown cup down with him,\\r\\nand stood it upon the stall with his other ware. The spinning woman and\\r\\nher two daughters came back with their fine cloths, and their wheel\\r\\nand their loom, and when he saw the golden-haired girl, he loved her\\r\\nstill more than before, for he thought her eyes were bluer and her\\r\\nsmile was brighter. He watched her all the time as she sat weaving, but\\r\\nsaid nothing, but when the fair was over, and they were packing their\\r\\ngoods to go on their way, he pressed the maid for her answer. Still\\r\\nshe hesitated, and then the potter took the little brown cup off his\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 92]\\r\\n\\r\\nstall, and poured into it some choice wine, and said to her,“If then you wish to go away, and never see me again, I pray you drink\\r\\none draught, in remembrance of the happy days we have had together.”The young girl took the cup, but no sooner had she tasted it than she\\r\\nput it down and turned her eyes on the potter, and said in a low voice,“I will stay with you always, if you want me, and will be a true wife\\r\\nto you, and love you better than anything on earth.”So the potter married her, and she went to live in his little cottage.Time passed, and the potter and his young wife lived together very\\r\\nhappily, and every day he thought her fairer and sweeter. And they had\\r\\na little baby girl with blue eyes like its mother’s, and the potter\\r\\nthought himself the happiest man on earth, and the little brown pot\\r\\nstood on the shelf, and the potter looked at it, and still he would not\\r\\nbelieve about the charm, for he said to himself, “My wife loved me for\\r\\nmy own sake, and not for any silly charm or nonsense.”[Pg 93-4][Pg 95]So for a time all things went well, but there came a day when the\\r\\npotter had to go to a neighbouring town and leave his wife at home\\r\\nalone all day. When he was gone she sat by the window with her little\\r\\nchild, and presently there came up outside a dark, rough-looking man,\\r\\nwith a wicked face, and he looked at her as she sat rocking the cradle,\\r\\nand thought she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen on earth.\\r\\nWhen he looked at her the potter’s wife was frightened, but when he\\r\\ntold her he was very hungry, and begged her for food and drink, she\\r\\nrose, for her heart was tender, and she fetched him bread and meat, and\\r\\nspread them on the table before him. So the rough man came into the\\r\\ncottage and sat at the table, and ate the potter’s bread and meat, and\\r\\ndrank his wine. “And who is your husband, and where is he?” he said. “I\\r\\nam sure he is a lucky man to have such a wife and such a home.”“Yes, truly,” said the potter’s wife. “We are very happy, and we love\\r\\neach other dearly, and we really have nothing else to wish for.”Then the gipsy man said, “But your dress is plain, and your rooms are\\r\\nbare; now, were you the wife of some wealthy man, he would give you\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 96]\\r\\n\\r\\npearls and diamonds for your neck, and beautiful silks and satins.”“No, but I don’t want them,” said the potter’s wife smiling. “My\\r\\nhusband works very hard, and he gives me all he can, and I am quite\\r\\ncontent with it.”“And you say he is a potter; then what sort of things does he make?”\\r\\nasked the gipsy man as he cast his eyes about the room, and they lit\\r\\nupon the little brown jug standing upon the shelf. “And did he make the\\r\\nlittle bowl there?”“I don’t know,” said his wife, and she took it down and turned it about\\r\\nin her hand. “I suppose so, but he has told me it was very old.”The gipsy man seized it eagerly, and poured wine in it, and looked\\r\\ninside it, and then he laughed, and stooping his head over it, said a\\r\\nfew words, and then laughed again.“I have seen cups like this before,” he said. “And they are worth a\\r\\nmint of money, though you would not think it. And have you never drunk\\r\\nout of it? Has it not been used?”“I don’t drink from it,” said the potter’s wife, “but I believe I did\\r\\nso once, and that was on the day when I promised my husband I would be\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 97]\\r\\n\\r\\nhis wife.”Then the gipsy laughed again and again. “See,” he said, “I am going a\\r\\nlong way off, perhaps to die by cold and hunger by the road-side, while\\r\\nyou and your husband are cosy and warm. You set small store by this\\r\\ncup, but it may be that in foreign countries I could sell it for what\\r\\nwould keep me for many a long day. Give it to me, I pray you, that I\\r\\nmay take it with me.”The potter’s wife hesitated and trembled. She was afraid of the man,\\r\\nand she thought he had a hard, bad face, but she did not want to seem\\r\\nunkind.“Well, take it,” she said; “but why should you want it?”Then the gipsy man came and caught her by the arm. “Now,” he said,\\r\\n“you are the fairest woman I have ever seen, and I am going away, and\\r\\nshall never see you again. So I beg you wish me God-speed, and drink my\\r\\nhealth out of the little brown cup you have given me. And if your lips\\r\\nhave touched it, it will be the dearest thing I have on earth!”[Pg 98]Then the potter’s wife was still more frightened, and trembled more\\r\\nthan before. But the man looked so dark and threatening, that she did\\r\\nnot like to refuse him, and she took the cup in her hand,“And then you will go on your way,” she said.“And then I shall go on my way,” cried the gipsy. “And you will wait\\r\\nhere till your husband comes, whom you love more than anything else on\\r\\nthis earth.”Then the potter’s wife bent her head and tasted the wine out of the\\r\\ncup, and wished the gipsy happiness. And when she had done so he\\r\\nlaughed again, long and low, till her heart sank with fear, and he\\r\\npicked up the cup and put it into his bundle, and went his way. Then\\r\\nthe potter’s wife sat down by the cradle, and almost cried, she knew\\r\\nnot why, and the whole room seemed cold, and when she looked out at the\\r\\nsunshine it looked dark, and she bent over the baby in the cradle with\\r\\nher tears falling.“Alack!” she cried, “why doesn’t my husband come home? Where is he\\r\\ngone? How cruel it is to leave me all alone here, so that any rough\\r\\nman may come into the house. In truth I don’t think he can love me\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 99]\\r\\n\\r\\nmuch, since all he thinks of is to go away and leave me; and as for me,\\r\\nsurely I could have had many a better husband, and one who should have\\r\\nloved me more. How foolish I was to marry him.”Thus she sat and lamented all day, and in the evening, when the potter\\r\\ndrove up to his door and cried out “Wife, wife,” she wouldn’t go out\\r\\nto receive him. And when he came in to their little sitting-room, he\\r\\nfound her with tears in her eyes, sitting lamenting and complaining.\\r\\nWhen he went up to her to take her in his arms and kiss her, she turned\\r\\naway from him and would not let him touch her, and the potter, who had\\r\\nnever seen his wife cross or angry, knew that there must be something\\r\\nwrong. She must be ill, he thought; to-morrow or the next day she will\\r\\nbe well again. So he urged her to rest well, and took no notice of her\\r\\nangry words; but the next day, and the next, there was no change, and\\r\\nthings were growing from bad to worse. For now the wife wouldn’t speak\\r\\nto him at all, and when she came nigh him she looked at him with anger,\\r\\nand would not even suffer him to touch the hem of her dress. Then the\\r\\npotter began to think of the little brown cup, and he looked up at the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 100]\\r\\n\\r\\nshelf and saw that it was not there, and he began to feel very much\\r\\nalarmed.“Why,” he said, “what has become of my little old brown cup that used\\r\\nto stand up on the shelf?”“I gave it to a gipsy man,” she answered scornfully. “He seemed to like\\r\\nit, and I didn’t see that I was obliged to keep all the rubbish that\\r\\nyou had in the house.”Then the potter groaned within himself and said,“But did you just take it off the shelf and give it to him, and did he\\r\\nask you for it? Why did he want it?”“Of course he asked for it,” said the wife very angrily, “and I just\\r\\ngave it him when I had drunk his health out of it, as he wished me to.”Then the potter was stricken with deadly fear, and remembered the words\\r\\nof the gipsy. “The first draught she will drink to your love, and the\\r\\nsecond draught she will drink to your hate,” and he knew in his heart\\r\\nthat the words were true, and that the cup carried with it a charm.He sat and thought and thought, and waited many days, hoping that his\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 101]\\r\\n\\r\\nwife would change, and love him as before, but she remained cold and\\r\\nhard. Then the potter packed a wallet full of clothes, and put some\\r\\nmoney in his pocket, and he went to his wife and said, “Wife, there is\\r\\na man somewhere who has done me a great wrong, and perhaps he did it\\r\\nunwittingly. I am going out to find him, and to make him right it, and\\r\\nthough you do not love me, you will bide here quietly with your baby\\r\\ntill I come back. And I do not know if that will be in months or in\\r\\nyears.” Then the potter’s wife fell a-crying.[Pg 102]“I do not love you, nay, I hate you, and shall be glad when you have\\r\\ngone, but perhaps it may be because I am a wicked woman; and I do not\\r\\nknow what has come over me, that now I want to fly away from you, when\\r\\nI used to think that I had the best husband on all this earth.” The\\r\\npotter sighed bitterly, but he kissed her cheeks, which felt as cold as\\r\\nice, and then he said good-bye to his baby, and started on his way with\\r\\nthe tears filling his eyes.When the potter had gone the wife cried sorely, but still she was glad\\r\\nthat she had not to see him, and for some time she lived with her baby\\r\\nhappily enough. She kept the house, and mended and swept and cleaned as\\r\\nbefore, and thought little of the potter or where he had gone; but by\\r\\nand by all her money began to be spent, and she knew that unless the\\r\\npotter returned she would soon be very poor, and the winter was coming\\r\\non, and she feared cold and hunger for her little one. So she went into\\r\\na garret where she kept her old weaving loom, and she brought it out,\\r\\nand she bought flax, and sat down to weave just as she used to, when\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 103]\\r\\n\\r\\nshe went round the country with her sister who spun the flax. And she\\r\\nfound that she could still weave her cloths very skilfully, and she\\r\\nbegan to sell them to the passers by, and in this way she earned her\\r\\nbread.The winter set in very cold and hard, and the potter’s wife felt very\\r\\nsad. “But perhaps,” she said, “it is thinking of the poor things\\r\\nwho are starving around with no homes,” for she never thought of\\r\\nher husband at all. And the flax began to be very dear, and she had\\r\\ndifficulty in buying it. “Instead of doing all these cheap clothes,”\\r\\nshe said, “it would be better to get very fine flax, and do a very very\\r\\nfine cloth; it will be the finest cloth I have ever woven, and I will\\r\\nsell it to some very rich lady.” So she bought the finest flax that\\r\\nmoney could bring her, and when she had woven a little bit of it, she\\r\\nsat and looked at it in her room, and she saw a tress of her own golden\\r\\nhair lying upon it, and she thought how beautiful it looked. Then she\\r\\nsaid—“There is no one now who loves me or my hair, so I will weave it into\\r\\na cloth with this very fine flax, and I must sell it for a very large\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 104]\\r\\n\\r\\nsum of money, or else I shall have nothing left to go on with.” But\\r\\nshe couldn’t think of any pattern in which the hair looked well with\\r\\nthe fine linen flax, till at last she hit on one in which there was a\\r\\ncup with a heart on the top of it. The cup she made of the gold hair,\\r\\nand the heart also. She worked at it for many long days, and when she\\r\\nhad finished it she looked at it, and was very much pleased, and said\\r\\nindeed it was the most beautiful cloth she had ever made; and now she\\r\\nmust make haste and take it in to the town and sell it for a great deal\\r\\nof money, or she and her child would begin to do badly for food and\\r\\nfire.The snow was lying heavily upon the ground, as the potter’s wife stood\\r\\nby the window looking at her cloth, when there crawled up outside the\\r\\nwindow a poor gipsy woman leading a little boy by the hand. She had\\r\\nbig black eyes and a brown face, but her cheeks were so thin that the\\r\\ncolour scarcely showed in them, and the potter himself would have had\\r\\nmuch ado to recognize her as the gipsy girl who made the cup years\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 105]\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore; and her clothes all hung upon her in rags, and her little boy\\r\\nwas crying bitterly with the cold. She knocked against the window with\\r\\nher poor thin hands. “Take me in,” she cried, “and have pity on me,\\r\\nfor I can go no further.” Then the potter’s wife opened the door, and\\r\\nthe gipsy woman entered the room with her little boy by her side, and\\r\\ncrouched by the fire.“Where is the potter who lived here?” said the gipsy. “It is long years\\r\\nago since I saw him, and now I have come back to pray that he would\\r\\ngive me food, for I am starving.”“No,” said the wife, “I know not where he is, for he is my husband, and\\r\\nhe has left me, and right glad of it am I; but if you will stay here I\\r\\nwill give you food and drink and attend to you, for, poor woman, you\\r\\nseem to me to be very ill; so stay here and I will attend to you till\\r\\nyou are well enough to go your way.”“There is only one way that I shall ever go,” said the gipsy, and she\\r\\nlooked into the fire with her big black eyes, “and that is the road\\r\\nwhich leads to the churchyard. But if he was your husband, why do you\\r\\nsay that you are glad he is away? Is he not kind to you?”[Pg 106]“He was very kind to me,” said the potter’s wife, “he gave me\\r\\neverything I wanted, and money and to spare, but for all that I could\\r\\nnot love him, and I am glad he has gone, and left me alone with my baby\\r\\ngirl.”“You are a foolish woman,” said the gipsy. “If you had a husband who\\r\\nloved you and worked for you well, you should have loved him and\\r\\ncherished him. My husband beat me, and was cruel to me, and stole all I\\r\\nhad. And now that I am dying, he has deserted me to die as I may.”Then the potter’s wife brought her food and bid her lie down, and dried\\r\\nher rags of clothes, and she wrapped the little boy in her own clothes,\\r\\nand gave him food and put him to sleep; and as she lay, the gipsy woman\\r\\nwatched her with her great black eyes, and at last she said, “Have you\\r\\na brown cup here, a little rough brown cup? did your husband give it to\\r\\nyou?”The potter’s wife stared with astonishment. “How did you know I had a\\r\\nlittle rough brown cup?” she said. “There was such a one, and it stood\\r\\nupon the shelf, but I have given it away. I gave it to a poor gipsy man\\r\\nwho begged it of me; he wanted it so badly that I couldn’t refuse, and\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 107]\\r\\n\\r\\nhe made me drink his health in it ere he took it away.”Then the gipsy woman raised her head, and her eyes looked blacker and\\r\\nher cheeks blacker.“And what was the gipsy man like?” she cried. “Had you drunk from the\\r\\ncup before? Can you remember?”“I remember well,” said the woman. “I drank from it on the day when I\\r\\npromised I would marry my husband, and I drank from it once again when\\r\\nI wished the gipsy God-speed, and soon after that, my husband left me,\\r\\nfor I could not bear to have him near me.”Then the gipsy cried out aloud, and said something in a language which\\r\\nthe woman did not understand, and beat her hands.“I think it was my husband,” she said. “Alack a day! to-morrow night\\r\\nI shall die, and who will take care of my little boy, and see that he\\r\\ndoes not starve? for his father would beat and ill-treat him if he\\r\\nfound him.” Then the potter’s wife kneeled down beside the gipsy woman,\\r\\nand kissed her on the forehead.“Be at peace,” she said. “If it be that you must die, die with a\\r\\nquiet heart, for I will keep your little boy. What is enough for two\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 108]\\r\\n\\r\\nis enough for three, and he shall call my little girl sister and me\\r\\nmother.”The gipsy said nothing, but she looked at the potter’s wife for long,\\r\\nand then she said, “And my clothes are all in rags, and I have no\\r\\ngarment in which you can wrap me for my grave.”Then the potter’s wife began to cry. “Be at peace,” she said, “for I\\r\\nhave a fine cloth made of flax and my own hair, and in it you can lie\\r\\nclad like a princess.”Then again the gipsy woman cried out words that the potter’s wife did\\r\\nnot understand, and again she beat her breast and lamented. But as\\r\\nevening drew nigh she turned to the potter’s wife, and told her all the\\r\\ntruth about the charms in the cup, and wept for the evil she had done\\r\\nher, who was so good and kind.The potter’s wife sat by her all that day, and into the dark hours of\\r\\nthe night, but when it was drawing nigh to twelve o’clock the gipsy\\r\\nwoman sat up, and stretched out her arms. “The wheel,” she cried,\\r\\n“bring me your husband’s wheel, and give me a piece of clay, that while\\r\\nthere is yet time I may throw my last cup, and you may drink from it\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 109]\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore the dawn and undo the harm I have worked.”The potter’s wife wondered much, but she feared to disobey her, and she\\r\\nwent out into her husband’s workshop, and she brought in his wheel and\\r\\na piece of clay which stood there, and placed them beside the gipsy.\\r\\nThe gipsy was so weak that she could scarcely sit up, but when she saw\\r\\nthe wheel she staggered to her feet, and took the clay in her thin\\r\\nlittle brown hands, and moulded it as she had done years before; and\\r\\nthen she set it on the wheel, and set the wheel spinning, and formed it\\r\\ninto a little brown bowl, and bent her head over it, and whispered into\\r\\nit.“Now drink,” she cried, “although the clay is still wet. Pour water\\r\\ninto it and drink from my little bowl, and wish me God-speed as you did\\r\\nto my husband. And then dress me in white and gold like a princess, for\\r\\nI must start upon my journey. But keep my little boy always, and if my\\r\\nhusband comes to search for me, give him my ring, but tell him that he\\r\\nshall never find me more.”The potter’s wife poured some water into the little clay cup, and\\r\\nstooped her face and drank it, that the woman might be content, and\\r\\nwhen she had done so, the gipsy folded her hands and lay back and\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 110]\\r\\n\\r\\ndied. But when she had tasted the water out of the wet clay, the\\r\\npotter’s wife thought of her husband, and she called his name, and\\r\\ncried to him to come and help her with the poor gipsy woman. And then\\r\\nshe thought of how long it was since he had been with her, and she\\r\\nbegan to cry, and wept bitterly as she leant over the dead woman.“Oh, where is he gone? why did I drive him from me?” she said. “Have\\r\\nI been mad? Truly the poor gipsy spoke rightly, that if a woman has a\\r\\nhusband who loves her and works for her, she should cherish him with\\r\\nall her might. Alas, alas! and now my husband is out in the wide world,\\r\\nand I am alone here with no one to help me; until this poor woman told\\r\\nme, I never knew how wrong I was.” Then she looked at the gipsy woman\\r\\nlying in all her rags, and she remembered her promise to her, and she\\r\\ntook the fine linen cloth in which was woven the gold heart and the\\r\\ngilt cup, and she clothed her in it as if she were a princess, and the\\r\\nnext day the poor woman was buried, and no one knew from whence she\\r\\ncame nor to whom she belonged.[Pg 111]Then the potter’s wife sat down, and grieved bitterly, for she didn’t\\r\\nknow what it would be best to do to find her husband again, and tell\\r\\nhim that she loved him as at first. At first she thought she would go\\r\\nout and seek for him in the wide, wide world, but then she remembered\\r\\nhow he bid her wait where she was till he came back, and she knew she\\r\\nought to do what he had told her; but as now she had three to keep\\r\\ninstead of two, she feared they would be very poor, and as she had\\r\\nburied the gipsy in the fine gold and white cloth woven with her hair,\\r\\nshe had not got it to sell, and she had not any money left wherewith\\r\\nto buy more fine thread to weave. The gipsy’s little boy was a pretty\\r\\nboy, with dark eyes like his mother’s, and when she looked at him she\\r\\nsaid they would all three starve together, but she would keep him, as\\r\\nshe had promised his mother, rather than turn him out into the cold\\r\\nstreets. So she washed him, and mended his rags as best she might, and\\r\\nthen she began to seek everywhere for something she might weave to\\r\\nsell, and keep them from starving. She wandered round the garden, and\\r\\nin and out of the house, and the gipsy boy, who was a clever, bright\\r\\nlad, went with her.[Pg 112]“What are you searching for?” he asked.“I am searching for thread, that I may weave into some kind of cloth\\r\\nand sell,” she said. “Otherwise we shall surely starve, for I have no\\r\\nmoney left to buy it with, and nothing more left to sell.”“I will go and get you something to weave,” said the boy, and he ran\\r\\nout into the road, and looked up and down it to see what would come\\r\\npast. Presently there came up a big cart laden with straw, and on the\\r\\ntop of the cart lay one man, while another drove. The horses went\\r\\nslowly, and the gipsy boy followed them, and began to beg.“Run off, little chap,” cried the man at the top, “I have no money to\\r\\ngive to beggars.”“But I don’t ask you for money,” cried the boy, “but of your charity\\r\\ngive me a handful of straw.”“And what do you want with a handful of straw?” asked the carter, as\\r\\nthe boy still went on begging.“Why, see!” cried the lad, “I am all in rags, but if my mother had a\\r\\nhandful of straw she can weave me a coat, and I shall be quite warm,”\\r\\nat which the men both laughed, and declared that the idea of a coat\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 113]\\r\\n\\r\\nof straw was very funny, but the driver said, “Well, give some to the\\r\\nlittle chap. I expect he comes from a lot of lying gipsies further on,\\r\\nand they want it for their animals, still it won’t do any harm to give\\r\\nhim a few wisps,” and so they flung down a bundle, and the boy picked\\r\\nit up, and ran back with it to the potter’s wife.“See what I have brought you,” he cried. “Now make that into a mat, and\\r\\nI will take it out and sell it, and bring you back the money.”The potter’s wife was amazed by his cleverness, but she knew that the\\r\\ngipsies had to live by their wits, and that teaches them to be sharp,\\r\\nso she sat down, and tried to weave the straw into a mat, as the gipsy\\r\\nboy had said.At first she found it very hard to use, for it was coarse and brittle,\\r\\nand she thought she could make nothing of it. The lad sat beside her,\\r\\nand cut it into even lengths for her, and chose out the good pieces,\\r\\nand at last betwixt them it was done, and it looked quite a smart\\r\\nlittle mat, and the boy took it on his back and ran away with it to the\\r\\nvillage.[Pg 114]“A mat, a mat,” he cried, “who wants to buy a good straw mat to wipe\\r\\ntheir feet on when they are dirty, or for the cat to sit on by the\\r\\nfire, or to put over the fowl-house and keep it warm?”At first all the people he met laughed at him, and said nobody wished\\r\\nto buy a mat at all. Then he turned into the ale-house. There were\\r\\nsome men smoking and keeping themselves warm by the fire, and when the\\r\\nhost saw him, and the mat over his shoulder, he said it was quite a\\r\\nwell-made thing, and he would have it to lay down by his doorway for\\r\\nin-comers to tread on; and then one and another looked at it, and the\\r\\nboy told them where it came from, and said he could bring them plenty\\r\\nmore straw mats and carpets, all as good or better, and so well worked\\r\\nthat they would last almost for ever; and presently one and another\\r\\nbegan to say that they would buy them, and when he had taken his money,\\r\\nthe gipsy boy ran home well content.So the potter’s wife sat all day weaving straw mats, and presently she\\r\\ngot to do them so well, that from far and near the people sent to buy\\r\\nthem of her. Then after a time she put patterns into them, made with\\r\\nred, and black, and white straws, but do what she could, the patterns\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 115]\\r\\n\\r\\nalways came out in the shape of a cup, and still she wept and grieved\\r\\nall day long. Then the gipsy lad said to her—“What are you crying for now? You have plenty to eat and drink. Tell me\\r\\nwhy you are crying, and I will help you if I can, because you took my\\r\\nmother into your house to die, and buried her in your fine cloth like a\\r\\nprincess.”“I cry because my husband has gone a long way off,” said the potter’s\\r\\nwife, “and he doesn’t know that I love him, and he will never come back\\r\\nto me, for when he went away I hated him.”“He will never know it if you don’t try to tell him,” said the gipsy\\r\\nboy. “You should tell it to every one you meet, to all the birds of the\\r\\nair, and the wild animals too. That is what my mother told me to do,\\r\\nif I wanted to send news abroad. You should say it even to the winds,\\r\\nand write it in the sand, and on the earth, and on the leaves of the\\r\\ntrees in case they blow about, for she said all things could pass on a\\r\\nsecret, though none can keep one. And why don’t you weave it into your\\r\\nmats too? For the people who buy them take them far and near, and maybe\\r\\nhe will see one, and know that you want him to come home again.”[Pg 116]Then the potter’s wife tried to weave her secret into her mats, and\\r\\nbeside the pattern of the cup she wove a little verse—“Now,” cried the gipsy boy, “your husband may see it, and perhaps he\\r\\nwill come home, and all will be well with us.”But still the potter journeyed far into the world, and wherever he went\\r\\nhe asked if any gipsy had been near there; and if there happened to be\\r\\na gipsy camp in the neighbourhood, he went to it at once, and asked\\r\\nfor a gipsy woman with red beads and gold chains in her hair, or for a\\r\\ngipsy man who carried a brown cup with him. But though he saw hundreds\\r\\nof gipsies, yet he never again saw the girl who had thrown the cup,\\r\\nand none of the men knew anything about the man, nor could tell him\\r\\nanything about the little brown bowl. Then he went to the shops in the\\r\\nbig towns where jars and bowls are sold, and asked for a cup that had\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 117]\\r\\n\\r\\na spell in it, for he thought if they sold such a one, they might know\\r\\nhow to help him to undo the work of the gipsy’s bowl, but everywhere\\r\\nthe people only laughed at him.So he went through strange countries, seeing strange things, but none\\r\\nof them gave him any pleasure, since he was always thinking of his wife\\r\\nat home. Then he returned to his native land, and pondered whether he\\r\\nshould go back to his own cottage, but his heart failed him, and he\\r\\nkept far from the little village where it stood.“It would be little use to go home,” he said, “for if my wife is not\\r\\nglad to see me, it is no home to me; and she will not be glad to see me\\r\\ntill I can find the gipsy and know how the charm can be broken.”One night he went into a booth where there were a number of men\\r\\ndrinking, and amongst them there was one who looked like a gipsy, a\\r\\ndark, savage-looking fellow who was talking loud, and boasting much\\r\\nof all he had done. The potter sat and listened to their talk, and\\r\\npresently they began quarrelling, and talking about who was the most\\r\\nbeautiful woman in the world. The gipsy cried out that he knew the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 118]\\r\\n\\r\\nmost beautiful, and that she had given him a parting gift and wished\\r\\nhim God-speed, and now he was going back to her, for he knew now the\\r\\nway to make her love him, and he meant to wed her and have her for his\\r\\nwife.Upon this the others laughed and jeered, and said, was it likely that\\r\\nsuch a beautiful woman would care for such a rough, ill-favoured fellow\\r\\nas he, and declared they didn’t think much of her beauty if she was\\r\\nwilling to marry him and to be his wife.Then another man standing near said that he knew where lived the most\\r\\nbeautiful woman on the face of the earth, though he did not believe\\r\\nthat she would ever be wife of his, still all the same it would be hard\\r\\nto beat her for loveliness; and she was a clever worker too, for she it\\r\\nwas who worked the mats that lay under his feet in the cart he drove.\\r\\nUpon this they all began to wrangle, and their words grew high.“And if the beautiful woman loved you so,” cried one man to the gipsy,\\r\\n“how could you come away and leave her?”The gipsy laughed. “She didn’t love me then,” he said, “but she will\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 119]\\r\\n\\r\\nnow, for I am taking her a charm which will make her love me more than\\r\\nany one on earth. She has only to drink out of the cup I carry here,\\r\\nand she will be mine for life.”Upon this they all laughed, and derided him still more.“Then let every one believe that what I say is true,” cried the gipsy,\\r\\nand from his bosom he took out a small brown bowl and waved it in the\\r\\nair, “and here is the cup to prove it.” And the potter’s heart almost\\r\\nstood still, for he recognized the cup which the gipsy girl had made\\r\\nfor him years before.The other man laughed scornfully. “That proves nothing,” he said. “I\\r\\nmight take the mat out from the cart and ask it to say if I spoke the\\r\\ntruth; but mats and cups have no tongues to speak with, though my mat\\r\\ncan say more than your cup, for there is a rhyme on it with a pattern\\r\\nof a cup; moreover, the rhyme is about a gipsy too.”“Let us see it,” cried they all.Then the man went out to his cart and fetched in a white and brown\\r\\nstraw mat, covered with a pattern made of cups, and he read the rhyme\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 120]\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich was written upon it—On hearing this the potter jumped up, and dashed into their midst, and\\r\\nseized the cup.“The gipsy speaks truth,” he cried, “when he says she is the most\\r\\nbeautiful woman in the world, but he speaks false when he says that she\\r\\nwill ever love him; for he has stolen that cup, and I shall take it\\r\\nfrom him, and if he tries to stop me, why then I will fight him, and\\r\\nlet every one see who is the better fellow of the two.”But when the gipsy had seen the rhyme upon the mat, he stood and stared\\r\\nas if he were made of stone, and said no word to the potter, and indeed\\r\\nscarcely seemed to notice that he had taken away the cup from him. Then\\r\\nthe potter turned to the man who owned the mat and said, “If you will\\r\\nsell me your mat I will pay you handsomely for it, and I beg you to\\r\\ntell me who made it, and where you got it, for I would like to buy some\\r\\nmore like it.”[Pg 121]The traveller was much astonished, but he told the potter that it was\\r\\nmade by a woman who lived in a village a little way off, and she sat by\\r\\nher doorway and wove mats, with a gipsy boy to help her; and she was\\r\\nthe loveliest woman he had ever seen on earth, with eyes just like blue\\r\\ncornflowers and hair like golden corn. Then the potter took his bowl\\r\\nand the mat and started to go home, but the gipsy slunk out of the room\\r\\nand went into the night, and nobody noticed him.Meantime the potter’s wife continued to grieve and lament, for in spite\\r\\nof her taking the gipsy boy’s advice, and telling all things that she\\r\\nloved her husband and wished him back, he did not come back to her; and\\r\\nthough she wove her rhyme into every mat that she made, she despaired\\r\\nof the potter’s ever seeing one. The only thing which seemed to console\\r\\nher, was the little brown clay cup that the gipsy woman had thrown for\\r\\nher, before she died. As it had never been baked in the oven, the clay\\r\\nwas dry and hard and cracked, and it was a sorry thing to look at, but\\r\\nstill the potter’s wife kept it beside her, and would drink out of\\r\\nnothing else, and from time to time she kissed it, and laid her cheek\\r\\nagainst it.[Pg 122]The gipsy boy said to her—“If I were you I should watch for my husband all day. I would weave my\\r\\nmats in the doorway, and look up the road both ways, from morn till\\r\\nnight, otherwise your husband will come back and go past the cottage\\r\\nand you will never know.” So she took her loom and sat by the roadway,\\r\\nand watched, and looked over the hill and to right and left for whoever\\r\\nmight come. And often the gipsy boy would watch too, and look from the\\r\\nother side of the cottage while the potter’s wife sat in the front. One\\r\\nday the gipsy boy ran round to her and said, “There is some one coming\\r\\nup the road who will come here, but it is not your husband. It is my\\r\\nfather, and he will want to take me away, and he will beat me as he did\\r\\nmy mother. And if he gets hold of the cup that my mother made for you,\\r\\nhe knows all her charms, and he can undo what she did, and perhaps can\\r\\nthrow some evil spell on us all, so that your husband will never return\\r\\nagain. So the best thing will be for you to give me the cup and let me\\r\\nhide myself with it, and then you must tell him that you do not know\\r\\nwhere I am, and if he asks, tell him that the cup is gone; and when he\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 123]\\r\\n\\r\\nis gone I will come back again, but promise that you will not give me\\r\\nup to him.”So the potter’s wife promised that she would never give up the little\\r\\nboy, and she bid him take the cup and run quickly and hide himself, and\\r\\nthen she took her little girl by the hand and sat and waited for the\\r\\ngipsy man to come, though she trembled with fear, and wished him far\\r\\naway.Presently the gipsy man came up to the front of the cottage where the\\r\\npotter’s wife sat, and bid her good-day.“I was here before,” he said. “And you gave me something to eat and\\r\\ndrink. Is your husband come back, for he was away then?”“My husband is away still,” she said. “But soon I hope he will be here.”Then the gipsy took up one of her mats which lay on the ground beside\\r\\nher, and looked at it.“You are clever with your loom,” he said; “but what do you mean by the\\r\\nlittle verse you put on all these mats?”“It is a little verse which can but be rightly read by one person,”\\r\\nshe answered; “and if he sees it, it will not matter whether others\\r\\nunderstand it or no.”[Pg 124]“And have you been here all alone since I came by?” asked the gipsy;\\r\\n“have no other gipsies been past? for I want to join some of my own\\r\\npeople, and perhaps you can tell me which way they are gone.”“One came not so long ago,” answered the potter’s wife, “but she was\\r\\nso tired with tramping far that she could go no further. So she has\\r\\nstayed, and rests in the churchyard. She was a gipsy woman with red\\r\\nbeads and coins in her hair. And I kept her and let her die in peace,\\r\\nand wrapped her in a cloth of white and gold.”“And did she do nothing while she rested here?” asked the gipsy man.\\r\\n“Did she make you no present to pay you for your trouble?”“She made me a present which paid me for my trouble well,” said the\\r\\nwoman, “though it was only a little cup of clay that was grey and wet.\\r\\nAnd she gave me this ring, and bid me give it to her husband if he came\\r\\nby here, and tell him that it was useless for him to seek her further.”The gipsy man looked at the ring she held out to him, and he turned\\r\\npale, and knit his brows.“And where is that cup?” he asked; “and where is her little boy? For I\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 125]\\r\\n\\r\\nwill take him with me into the world.”“I don’t know where he is gone,” said the potter’s wife; “as for the\\r\\ncup, he took it with him when he went.”Meantime the gipsy boy had hidden in a hay-stack quite close to the\\r\\ncottage, from where he could see the roadways all round, and he looked\\r\\nto right and left for who should pass, for he was still half afraid\\r\\nthat his father might come and search for him, and take him away by\\r\\nforce. As he lay and watched he saw a man coming over the hill, who\\r\\nlooked spent and tired, as if he had walked far. He seemed to know the\\r\\npath well, and he came straight to the cottage, but he did not come in,\\r\\nbut waited near as if he wanted to see who was there. Then the gipsy\\r\\nboy said to himself—“Perhaps this is the potter himself, whom she has been looking for all\\r\\nthis time.” So he slid down and ran to the man and began to pretend to\\r\\nbeg.The man looked at him and said—“You are a gipsy’s child. Where do you come from? Are you living under\\r\\na hedge, or do you come from a gipsy’s camp near?”[Pg 126]“It is true I am a gipsy’s child,” answered the boy, “but I am living\\r\\nunder no hedge, but in that little cottage, for the woman who lives\\r\\nthere keeps me for love of my mother, who helped her when she was in\\r\\ntrouble.”“And what did your mother do for the woman?” asked the man, who was no\\r\\nother than the potter. “It must have been a great service, that she\\r\\nshould be willing to take you and keep you.”“She saved her from an evil charm that had been cast upon her,”\\r\\nanswered the boy, “and taught her to love her husband again, and she\\r\\nwaits his return now and longs for him to come. Therefore she promised\\r\\nto keep me with her, but now I dare not go into the cottage, because my\\r\\nfather, who is a gipsy, is there, and I am afraid lest he may take me\\r\\naway with him.”When the potter heard that the gipsy man was there he would have run\\r\\nstraight into the cottage, but the boy implored him to listen first\\r\\nand hear what he was saying. So they crept round to the side of the\\r\\ncottage, and they heard the gipsy man growing angry, and threatening\\r\\nthe potter’s wife, that if she did not tell him where his boy had gone\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 127]\\r\\n\\r\\nhe would seize her by the hair and wring her throat, in spite of her\\r\\nbeing so fair a woman. At this the potter waited no longer, but burst\\r\\ninto the cottage, and seized the gipsy and hurled him out of the house\\r\\nwith all his might; but he and his wife never looked to see if he was\\r\\nhurt or no, for they looked at nothing but each other and the little\\r\\nchild that the potter’s wife held by the hand. And the gipsy man went\\r\\naway, and they never heard of him again.Then the potter’s wife showed her husband the gipsy boy, and told him\\r\\nof her promise to his mother, and of all he had done for her, and\\r\\nbegged him that he would let her keep him with them. And the potter\\r\\npromised that she should, and said that when he grew up to be a man he\\r\\nwould teach him his trade, and make him a potter like himself. So they\\r\\nall lived happily together, and the gipsy boy learned to make cups and\\r\\nbowls, and was very clever at doing them, but they were cups and bowls\\r\\nthat carried no charms with them, and so could do no one any harm that\\r\\ndrank from them.[Pg 128]\\nOnce there lived\\r\\nan old gentleman who was a very rich old gentleman,\\r\\nand able to buy nearly everything he wanted. He had earned all his\\r\\nwealth for himself by trading in a big city, and now he had grown so\\r\\nfond of money that he loved it better than anything else in the world,\\r\\nand thought of nothing except how he could save it up and make more.\\r\\nBut he never seemed to have time to enjoy himself with all that he had\\r\\nearned, and he was very angry if he was asked to give money to others.\\r\\nHe lived in a handsome house all alone, and he had a very good cook who\\r\\ncooked him a sumptuous dinner every day, but he rarely asked any one\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 129]\\r\\n\\r\\nto share it with him, though he loved eating and drinking, and always\\r\\nhad the best of wine and food. His cook and his other servants knew\\r\\nthat he was greedy and hard, and cared for nobody, and though they\\r\\nserved him well because he paid them, they none of them loved him.It was one Christmas, and the snow lay thick upon the ground, and the\\r\\nwind howled so fiercely that the old gentleman was very glad he was not\\r\\nobliged to go out into the street, but could sit in his comfortable\\r\\narm-chair by the fire and keep warm.“It really is terrible weather,” he said to himself, “terrible\\r\\nweather;” and he went to the window and looked out into the street,\\r\\nwhere all the pavements were inches deep in snow. “I am very glad that\\r\\nI need not go out at all, but can sit here and keep warm for to-day,\\r\\nthat is the great thing, and I shall have some ado to keep out the cold\\r\\neven here with the fire.”He was leaving the window, when there came up in the street outside\\r\\nan old man, whose clothes hung in rags about him, and who looked half\\r\\nfrozen. He was about the same age as the old gentleman inside the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 130]\\r\\n\\r\\nwindow, and the same height, and had grey, curly hair, like his, and\\r\\nif they had been dressed alike any one would have taken them for two\\r\\nbrothers.“Oh, really,” said the old gentleman irritably, “this is most annoying.\\r\\nThe parish ought to take up these sort of people, and prevent their\\r\\nwandering about the streets and molesting honest folk,” for the poor\\r\\nold man had taken off his hat, and began to beg.“It is Christmas Day,” he said, and though he did not speak very loud,\\r\\nthe old gentleman could hear every word he said quite plainly through\\r\\nthe window. “It is Christmas Day, and you will have your dinner here in\\r\\nyour warm room. Of your charity give me a silver shilling that I may go\\r\\ninto an eating-shop, and have a dinner too.”“A silver shilling!” cried the old gentleman, “I never heard of such a\\r\\nthing! Monstrous! Go away, I never give to beggars, and you must have\\r\\ndone something very wicked to become so poor.”But still the old man stood there, though the snow was falling on his\\r\\nshoulders, and on his bare head. “Then give me a copper,” he said;\\r\\n“just one penny, that to-day I may not starve.”[Pg 131]“Certainly not,” cried the old gentleman; “I tell you I never give to\\r\\nbeggars at all.” But the old man did not move.“Then,” he said, “give me some of the broken victuals from your table,\\r\\nthat I may creep into a doorway and eat a Christmas dinner there.”“I will give you nothing,” cried the old gentleman, stamping his foot.\\r\\n“Go away. Go away at once, or I shall send for the policeman to take\\r\\nyou away.”The old beggar-man put on his hat and turned quietly away, but what\\r\\nthe old gentleman thought was very odd was, that instead of seeming\\r\\ndistressed he was laughing merrily, and then he looked back at the\\r\\nwindow, and called out some words, but they were in a foreign tongue,\\r\\nand the old gentleman could not understand them. So he returned to his\\r\\ncomfortable arm-chair by the fire, still murmuring angrily that beggars\\r\\nought not to be allowed to be in the streets.Next morning the snow fell more thickly than ever, and the streets were\\r\\nalmost impassable, but it did not trouble the old gentleman, for he\\r\\nknew he need not go out and get wet or cold. But in the morning when he\\r\\ncame down to breakfast, to his great surprise there was a cat on the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 132]\\r\\n\\r\\nhearthrug in front of the fire, looking into it, and blinking lazily.\\r\\nNow the old gentleman had never had any animal in his house before,\\r\\nand he at once went to it and said “Shoo-shoo!” and tried to turn it\\r\\nout. But the cat did not move, and when the old gentleman looked at it\\r\\nnearer, he could not help admiring it very much. It was a very large\\r\\ncat, grey and black, and had extremely long soft hair, and a thick soft\\r\\nruff round its neck. Moreover, it looked very well fed and cared for,\\r\\nand as if it had always lived in comfortable places. Somehow it seemed\\r\\nto the old gentleman to suit the room and the rug and the fire, and to\\r\\nmake the whole place look more prosperous and cosy even than it had\\r\\ndone before.“A fine creature! a very handsome cat!” he said to himself; “I should\\r\\nreally think that a reward would be offered for such an animal, as it\\r\\nhas evidently been well looked after and fed, so it would be a pity to\\r\\nturn it away in a hurry.”One thing struck him as very funny about the cat, and that was that\\r\\nthough the ground was deep in snow and slush outside, the cat was quite\\r\\ndry, and its fur looked as if it had just been combed and brushed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 133]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old gentleman called to his cook and asked if she knew how the cat\\r\\nhad come in, but she declared she had not seen it before, and said\\r\\nshe believed it must have come down the chimney as all the doors and\\r\\nwindows had been shut and bolted. However, there it was, and when his\\r\\nown breakfast was finished the old gentleman gave it a large saucer of\\r\\nmilk, which it lapped up not greedily or in a hurry, but as if it were\\r\\nquite used to good food and had had plenty of it always.“It really is a very handsome animal, and most uncommon,” said the\\r\\nold gentleman, “I shall keep it awhile and look out for the reward;”\\r\\nbut though he looked at all the notices in the street and in the\\r\\nnewspapers, the old gentleman could see no notice about a reward being\\r\\noffered for a grey and black cat, so it stayed on with him from day to\\r\\nday.Every day the cat seemed to his master to grow handsomer and handsomer.\\r\\nThe old gentleman never loved anything but himself, but he began to\\r\\ntake a sort of interest in the strange cat, and to wonder what sort\\r\\nit was—if it was a Persian or a Siamese, or some curious new sort of\\r\\nwhich he had never heard. He liked the sound of its lazy contented\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 134]\\r\\n\\r\\npurring after its food, which seemed to speak of nothing but comfort\\r\\nand affluence. So the cat remained on till nearly a year had passed\\r\\naway.It was not very long before Christmas that an acquaintance of the old\\r\\ngentleman’s came to his rooms on business. He knew a great deal about\\r\\nall sorts of animals and loved them for their own sakes, but of course\\r\\nhe had never talked to the old gentleman about them, because he knew he\\r\\ndid not love anything. But when he saw the grey cat, he said at once—“Do you know that this is a very valuable creature, and I should think\\r\\nwould be worth a great deal?”At these words the old gentleman’s heart beat high. Here, he thought,\\r\\nwould be a piece of great luck if a stray cat could make him richer\\r\\nthan he was before.“Why, who would want to buy it?” he said. “I don’t know anybody who\\r\\nwould be so foolish as to give any money for a cat which is of no\\r\\nuse in life except to catch mice, when you can so easily get one for\\r\\nnothing.”[Pg 135]“Ah, but many people are very fond of cats, and would give much for\\r\\nrare sorts like this. If you want to sell it, the right thing would\\r\\nbe to send it to the Cat Show, and there you would most likely take a\\r\\nprize for it, and then some one would be sure to buy it, and, it may\\r\\nbe, would give a great deal. I don’t know what kind it is, or where it\\r\\ncomes from, for I have never seen one the least like it, but for that\\r\\nreason it is very sure to be valuable.”Upon this the old gentleman almost laughed with joy.“Where is the Cat Show?” he asked; “and when is it to be held?”“There will be a Cat Show in this city quite soon,” said his\\r\\nacquaintance; “and it will be a particularly good one, for the new\\r\\nPrincess is quite crazy about cats, and she is coming to it, and it is\\r\\nsaid that she doesn’t mind what she gives for a cat if she sees one she\\r\\nlikes.”So then he told the old gentleman how he should send his name and the\\r\\ncat’s name to the people who managed the show, and where it was to be\\r\\nheld, and went away, leaving the old gentleman well pleased, but to\\r\\nhimself he laughed and said, “I don’t think that old man thinks of\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 136]\\r\\n\\r\\nanything on earth but making money. How pleased he was at the idea of\\r\\nselling that beautiful cat if he could get something for it!”When he had gone, the grey puss came and rubbed itself about his\\r\\nmaster’s legs, and looked up in his face as though it had understood\\r\\nthe conversation, and did not like the idea of being sent to the show.\\r\\nBut the old gentleman was delighted, and sat by the fire and mused on\\r\\nwhat he was likely to get for the cat, and wondered if it would not\\r\\ntake a prize.“I shall be sorry to have to send it away,” he said; “still, if I could\\r\\nget a good round sum of money it would be a real sin not to take it, so\\r\\nyou will have to go, puss; and it really was extraordinary good luck\\r\\nfor me that you ever came here.”The days passed, and Christmas Day came, and again the snow fell, and\\r\\nthe ground was white. The wind whistled and blew, and on Christmas\\r\\nmorning the old gentleman stood and looked out of the window at the\\r\\nfalling snow and rain, and the grey cat stood beside him, and rubbed\\r\\nitself against his hand. He rather liked stroking it, it was so soft\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 137]\\r\\n\\r\\nand comfortable, and when he touched the long hair he always thought of\\r\\nhow much money he should get for it.This morning he saw no old beggar-man outside the window, and he said\\r\\nto himself: “I really think they manage better with the beggars than\\r\\nthey used to, and are clearing them from the town.”But just as he was leaving the window he heard something scratching\\r\\noutside, and there crawled on to the window-sill another cat. It was\\r\\na very different creature to the grey cat on the rug. It was a poor,\\r\\nthin, wretched-looking animal, with ribs sticking through its fur, and\\r\\nit mewed in the most pathetic manner, and beat itself against the pane.\\r\\nWhen it saw it, the handsome grey puss was very much excited, and ran\\r\\nto and fro, and purred loudly.“Oh you disgraceful-looking beast!” said the old gentleman angrily;\\r\\n“go away, this is not the place for an animal like you. There is\\r\\nnothing here for stray cats. And you look as if you had not eaten\\r\\nanything for months. How different to my puss here!” and he tapped\\r\\nagainst the window to drive it away. But still it would not go, and\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 138]\\r\\n\\r\\nthe old gentleman felt very indignant, for the sound of its mewing was\\r\\nterrible. So he opened the window, and though he did not like to touch\\r\\nthe miserable animal, he took it up and hurled it away into the snow,\\r\\nand it trotted away, and in the deep snow he could not see the way it\\r\\nwent.But that evening, after he had had his Christmas dinner, as he sat by\\r\\nthe fire with the grey puss on the hearthrug beside him, he heard again\\r\\nthe noise outside the window, and then he heard the stray cat crying\\r\\nand mewing to be let in, and again the grey and black cat became very\\r\\nmuch excited, and dashed about the room, and jumped at the window as if\\r\\nit wanted to open it.“I shall really be quite glad when I have sold you at the Cat Show,”\\r\\nsaid the old gentleman, “if I am going to have all sorts of stray cats\\r\\nworrying here,” and for the second time he opened the window, and\\r\\nseized the trembling, half-starved creature, and this time he threw\\r\\nit with all his might as hard as he could throw. “And now there is an\\r\\nend of you, I hope,” he said as he heard it fall with a dull thud, and\\r\\nsettled himself again in his arm-chair, and the grey puss returned to\\r\\nthe hearthrug, but it did not purr or rub itself against its master.[Pg 139]Next morning when he came down to breakfast, the old gentleman poured\\r\\nout a saucer of milk for his cat as usual. “You must be well fed if you\\r\\nare going to be shown at the show,” he said, “and I must not mind a\\r\\nlittle extra expense to make you look well. It will all be paid back,\\r\\nso this morning you shall have some fish as well as your milk.” Then he\\r\\nput the saucer of milk down by the cat, but it never touched it, but\\r\\nsat and looked at the fire with its tail curled round it.“Oh, well, if you have had so much already that you don’t want it, you\\r\\ncan take it when you do,” so he went away to his work and left the\\r\\nsaucer of milk by the fire. But when he came back in the evening there\\r\\nwas the saucer of milk and the piece of fish, and the grey cat had not\\r\\ntouched them. “This is rather odd,” said the old gentleman; “however, I\\r\\nsuppose cook has been feeding you.”Next morning it was just the same. When he poured out the milk the cat\\r\\nwouldn’t lap it, but sat and looked at the fire. The old gentleman felt\\r\\na little anxious, for he fancied that the animal’s fur did not look\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 140]\\r\\n\\r\\nso bright as usual, and when in the evening and the next day and the\\r\\nnext, it would not lap its milk, or even smell the nice pieces of fish\\r\\nhe gave it, he was really uncomfortable. “The creature is getting ill,”\\r\\nhe said, “and this is most provoking. What will be the use of my having\\r\\nkept it for a year, if now I cannot show it?” He scolded his cook\\r\\nfor having given it unwholesome food, but the cook swore it had had\\r\\nnothing. Anyhow it was growing terribly thin, and all day long it sat\\r\\nin front of the fire with its tail hanging down, not curled up neatly\\r\\nround it, and its coat looked dull and began to come out in big tufts\\r\\nof hair.“Now really I shall have to do something,” said the old gentleman,\\r\\n“it is enough to make any one angry! No one would believe that this\\r\\ncould be a prize cat. It looks almost as wretched as that stray beast\\r\\nthat came to the window on Christmas Day.” So he went to a cat and\\r\\ndog doctor, who lived near, and asked him to come in and see a very\\r\\nbeautiful cat which had nothing the matter with it, but which refused\\r\\nto eat its food. The cat’s doctor came and looked at the cat, and then\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 141]\\r\\n\\r\\nlooked very grave, and shook his head, and looked at it again.“I don’t know what sort of cat it is,” he said, “for I never saw any\\r\\nother like it, but it is a very handsome beast, and must be very\\r\\nvaluable. Well, I will leave you some physic for it, and I hope you may\\r\\nbe able to pull it round, but with these foreign cats you never know\\r\\nwhat ails them, and they are hard to cure.”Now the day was close at hand when the cat should have been sent to the\\r\\nshow, and the old gentleman was getting more and more uneasy, for the\\r\\ngrey cat lay upon the rug all day and never moved, and its ribs could\\r\\nalmost be seen through its side, so thin had it grown. And oddly enough\\r\\nthe old gentleman, who had never cared for any one or anything in his\\r\\nlife except himself, began to feel very unhappy, not only because of\\r\\nnot getting the money, but because he did not like to think of losing\\r\\nthe cat itself. He sent for his friend who had first told him about the\\r\\nCat Show, and asked his advice, but his friend could not tell him what\\r\\nto do with it.“Well, well,” he said, “this is a bad business, for I have told every\\r\\none that you are going to exhibit a most extraordinarily beautiful\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 142]\\r\\n\\r\\ncat, and now this poor creature is really fit for nothing but the\\r\\nknacker’s yard. I think, maybe, some naturalist would give you a good\\r\\nprice for its skin, as it is so very uncommon, and if I were you I\\r\\nshould kill it at once, for if it dies a natural death its skin won’t\\r\\nbe worth a brass farthing.” At these words the grey cat lifted its\\r\\nhead, and looked straight into the old gentleman’s face, as if it\\r\\ncould understand, and for the first time for many a long year, the old\\r\\ngentleman felt a feeling of pity in his heart, and was angry with his\\r\\nfriend for his suggestion.“I won’t have it killed,” he cried; “why, I declare, though it does\\r\\nseem absurd, I have lived with this creature for a year, and I feel as\\r\\nif it were my friend, and if it would only get well and sit up on the\\r\\nhearthrug, I shouldn’t mind about the money one bit!”At this his friend was greatly astonished, and went away wondering,\\r\\nwhile the old gentleman sat by the fire and watched the cat lying\\r\\npanting on the rug.“Poor pussy, poor old pussy!” he said, “it is a pity that you can’t\\r\\nspeak and tell me what you want. I am sure I would give it to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 143]\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as he spoke there came a noise outside, and he heard a mewing, and\\r\\nlooking through the window he saw the same thin ugly brown cat that\\r\\nhad come there last Christmas, and it looked as thin and wretched as\\r\\never. When she heard the sound the grey cat stood up on her tottering\\r\\nfeet and tried to walk to the window. This time the old gentleman did\\r\\nnot drive it away, but looked at it, and almost felt sorry for it; it\\r\\nlooked almost as thin and ill as his own grey puss.“You are an ugly brute,” he said, “and I don’t want you always hanging\\r\\nabout; still, maybe you would be none the worse for a little milk now,\\r\\nand it might make you look better.” So he opened the window a little,\\r\\nand then he shut it and then he opened it again, and this time the\\r\\nbrown cat crawled into the room, and went straight to the hearthrug to\\r\\nthe grey puss. There was a big saucer of milk on the hearthrug, and the\\r\\nbrown cat began to lap it at once, and the old gentleman never stopped\\r\\nit.He thought as he watched it, that it grew fatter under his eyes as it\\r\\ndrank, and when the saucer was empty he took a jug and gave it some\\r\\nmore. “I really am an old fool,” he said; “that is a whole pennorth\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 144]\\r\\n\\r\\nof milk.” No sooner had he poured out the fresh milk than the grey\\r\\ncat raised itself, and sitting down by the saucer began to lap it as\\r\\nwell, as if it were quite well. The old gentleman stared with surprise.\\r\\n“Well, this is the queerest thing,” he said. So he took some fish and\\r\\ngave it to the strange cat, and then, when he offered some to his own\\r\\npuss, it ate it as if there was nothing the matter. “This is most\\r\\nremarkable,” said the old gentleman; “perhaps it was the company of a\\r\\ncreature of its own sort that my cat needed, after all.” And the grey\\r\\ncat purred and began to rub itself against his legs.So for the next few days the two cats lay together on the hearthrug,\\r\\nand though it was too late to send the grey cat to the show, the old\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 145]\\r\\n\\r\\ngentleman never thought about it, so pleased was he that it had got\\r\\nwell again.But seven nights after the stray cat had come in from outside, as the\\r\\nold gentleman lay asleep in bed at night, he felt something rub itself\\r\\nagainst his face, and heard his cat purring softly, as though it wanted\\r\\nto say “good-bye.” “Be quiet, puss, and lie still till the morning,” he\\r\\nsaid. But when he came down to have his breakfast in the morning, there\\r\\nsat the brown tabby, looking fat and comfortable by the fire, but the\\r\\ngrey cat was not there, and though they looked for it everywhere, no\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 146]\\r\\n\\r\\none could find it, though all the windows and doors had been shut, so\\r\\nthey could not think how it could have got away. The old gentleman was\\r\\nvery unhappy about it, but he looked at the strange cat on his hearth\\r\\nand said, “it would be unkind now to send this poor thing away, so it\\r\\nmay as well stay here.”When she heard him speaking of its being unkind, his old cook burst out\\r\\nlaughing. “Perhaps,” she said, “’twas a fairy cat, as it could get away\\r\\nthrough bolts and locks, and nothing but a fairy could have taught my\\r\\nmaster to think of a thing being unkind or not. I only hope that now\\r\\nhe’ll think of some one in this world besides himself and his money.”\\r\\nAnd sure enough from that time the old gentleman began to forget about\\r\\nhis money, and to care for the people about him, and it was all the\\r\\ndoing of the strange cat who had come from no one knew where, and gone\\r\\naway to no one knew where.[Pg 147]\\nOnce upon a time there was a village on the top of a mountain, where\\r\\nduring the winter months the villagers saw no one but each other, for\\r\\nthe mountain was so steep and the path so narrow that, when it was\\r\\nblocked with ice, it was dangerous to ascend: so during the winter\\r\\nmonths the people lived by themselves, and cheered themselves as\\r\\nthey might in the long dreary evenings, with games and dancing and\\r\\nsinging and playing on pipes, for they were cheerful folk, joyous and\\r\\nlight-hearted. The sweetest singer in the village was a lad named\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 148]\\r\\n\\r\\nOthmar; his voice was as sweet as a nightingale’s before the dawn,\\r\\nand also he was the handsomest young fellow in all the country round.\\r\\nStrangers turned to look after him as he went by; he was tall and\\r\\nstraight, and had curly brown hair, and big brown eyes, and lips that\\r\\nalways smiled. He lived with his old mother, who was a widow, and he\\r\\nworked for them both in the fields and on the farms. When he was a\\r\\nboy he learned the notes of all the birds, and could imitate them so\\r\\nexactly that they would fly down to him and settle on his shoulders.\\r\\nWhen the farmers had sown their fields, and the birds would have come\\r\\nto pick up the grain, they sent for Othmar, and he sang and whistled\\r\\ntill they all left the field and flew after him. So often he was called\\r\\nthe bird-boy.One evening before the winter had set in, or the roads were blocked\\r\\nwith ice, there came along the high road into the village, a dwarf in\\r\\na yellow cap leading a donkey, on whose back were fastened numberless\\r\\nmusical instruments. Fiddles of all sorts, and viols, horns, trumpets,\\r\\nand pipes, and a big drum, and a small one with triangles and cymbals.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 149]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the village the little man stopped and looked about\\r\\nhim. “Who would like to hear my music?” he cried, and then as the\\r\\nvillagers came crowding around him, he bade them all sit down while he\\r\\nunpacked his mule, but he forbade any of them to help him, or to touch\\r\\none of the instruments. “For mine is no common music,” he quoth; “all\\r\\nthese I have made myself, and in each is a machine which makes it go on\\r\\nplaying by itself, if once I start it. See here!” and he took up a long\\r\\npipe and began to blow, and there came forth the sweetest notes that\\r\\nhad ever been heard from any pipe. The little man paused for a minute,\\r\\nwith the pipe in his hand, and then laid it down on the ground, when,\\r\\nwonderful to relate, it went on playing of itself.All the villagers stared with surprise, and some called out that it\\r\\nwas magic, and crossed themselves, but the little man took up another\\r\\npipe, and set that going too, and then the horns and the trumpets, and\\r\\nthe drums and the cymbals, and then he took a fiddle and drew the bow\\r\\nacross it, and how it played! It made the people weep and laugh. Othmar\\r\\nlay on the ground listening, and it seemed to him as if the sound were\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 150]\\r\\n\\r\\nmade of silver, and when the musician had started them, and all the\\r\\nother fiddles were playing together, he felt as if he should go mad for\\r\\njoy to hear anything so lovely.Just behind where Othmar lay sat a young girl, named Hulda. She was\\r\\nan orphan, and dwelt alone with an old woman, who gave her food and\\r\\nlodging for sweeping out her room, and cleaning and cooking. Also Hulda\\r\\nmade money for her by going out to work for the other women in the\\r\\nvillage. She was neither pretty nor clever, but she was a good girl,\\r\\nand if any of the villagers were ill or in trouble, it was for Hulda\\r\\nthey would send at once, because they knew she would spare no pains to\\r\\nhelp them, and would think nothing too much trouble. She had played\\r\\nwith Othmar ever since they were babies, and loved him dearly. She was\\r\\nthe only one who listened to the music who did not think it beautiful.\\r\\nShe shuddered as she heard it, and she sat and watched Othmar and saw\\r\\nthat there were tears in his eyes, and she grieved that she did not\\r\\nlove it as he did.When at last the instruments stopped and the listeners began to feel\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 151]\\r\\n\\r\\nfor money for the musician, he laughed and said, “You need not give me\\r\\nmoney, for I am very rich, and don’t need it. In return for my playing,\\r\\nI only ask for one recompense. Let any of your young folks who sing,\\r\\nsing me a song, for I too love hearing music that is not my own.” On\\r\\nthis the villagers began to look round for all who could sing, and they\\r\\nchose out some three or four, and begged them to sing their very best\\r\\nto the wonderful musician. Among them was Othmar, but they all bid him\\r\\nwait to the last, as his would be the best. Whilst the others were\\r\\nsinging, the little man did not seem to heed them much, though they\\r\\ntried hard to sing well, and chose their prettiest songs, but their\\r\\nvoices sounded very rough and poor after the playing.But when Othmar began he stopped twanging the fiddle-strings and\\r\\nwatched him. Othmar’s voice rang out clear and sweet, and all the\\r\\nvillage folk felt proud of his singing, even after hearing the\\r\\nwonderful instruments. When he ceased the little man rose, and said—“You have a sweet voice, my boy, be sure that you always use it well;\\r\\nand now I must be going my way, but as I am a stranger here, perhaps\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 152]\\r\\n\\r\\nyou would not mind setting me on my road, and showing me the best way\\r\\nover the hill.”Othmar sprang up, delighted to go with him, but Hulda, who watched from\\r\\nbehind, came up to him and whispered—“Oh, Othmar, don’t let him take you far—come back soon.”“How silly you are, Hulda!” said Othmar, almost angrily. “Of course I\\r\\nshall come back, but I shall go with him as far as he wants, and then,\\r\\nperhaps, he will let me hear him play again.”Othmar and the little dwarf started with the mule laden with\\r\\ninstruments, and Othmar led the way down the best road. The dwarf did\\r\\nnot speak at all, and so they went on in silence till they had got on\\r\\nto the top of a high hill where they could see the country all round\\r\\nfor miles, and the moon was beginning to rise. Here the musician\\r\\nstopped his mule, and stood for a while looking all round. Then he\\r\\nturned, and said to Othmar—“I know now where I am, and here will I\\r\\nstay for to-night, but first before you leave me, would you not like to\\r\\nhear my fiddles and horns again?”[Pg 153]“That I would,” cried Othmar, and he sat himself down on the ground\\r\\ndelighted, while the little man unloaded the mule.“And now,” he said to Othmar with a twisted smile, “you shall hear them\\r\\nplay as no one has ever heard them. Yes, and you shall see them too;”\\r\\nthen he laid them in rows—the fiddles first, and the viols, and then\\r\\nthe horns and trumpets, and last the drums and cymbals and triangles,\\r\\nand clapped his hands, giving a long, shrill whistle. As he whistled,\\r\\nthe instruments rose from the ground, and they began to swell, and\\r\\ntheir shapes to change till no longer did they look like musical\\r\\ninstruments, but like human beings, only each had in a strange way kept\\r\\nthe shape it had formerly. The flutes and pipes were tall and thin,\\r\\nand they and the violins had changed into beautiful girls with slender\\r\\nthroats, and the trumpets were all men and boys of different sizes, but\\r\\nthe drum was the strangest of all, for it was a fat man with very short\\r\\nlegs. The moon had risen and Othmar could see them all quite clearly,\\r\\nand though he trembled with fear and his heart beat high, yet still\\r\\nhe watched. They stood silent together for a space in a weird crowd,\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 154]\\r\\n\\r\\nand then the dwarf waved his arms and called, “Ay! are you all there,\\r\\nmy children?—yes, one, two three four five, six seven eight, nine\\r\\nten eleven twelve, thirteen—that is right. Come practice, practice,\\r\\npractice, and then you shall have a game, and see who Othmar loves\\r\\nbest, and who he will kiss first.”Then they all began to sing together, but each voice was like the sound\\r\\nof its own instrument, only it said words through its tones, and in\\r\\nOthmar’s ears their music sounded as never music had sounded before.\\r\\nThe voices of the violin girls were so sweet that he felt as if he must\\r\\nweep to hear them, while the sound of the pipes and trumpets filled him\\r\\nwith longing to go into the world and fight and win battles. He sat on\\r\\nthe ground and listened to them like one in a trance, and he felt as if\\r\\nhe never wished to rise or go away again. The dwarf sat on a hillock\\r\\nnear, and did not seem to heed them much. When Othmar took his eyes\\r\\nfrom the dancers for a minute, he found that the place was quite full\\r\\nof all the animals who are never seen by day, but who fly out by night.\\r\\nThere were crowds of bats and owls, and odd moths, all poised in the\\r\\nair, and seeming to watch the musicians and listen to their singing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 155]\\r\\n\\r\\nThen when he looked on the ground, he saw that strange wood-snakes and\\r\\ntoads had come out boldly, and with their heads turned towards the\\r\\ndancers remained motionless and watched them, whilst near him green and\\r\\nbrown lizards lay still as stone, with heads on one side, all staring\\r\\nthrough the dusky night at the singers. Othmar thought he only had\\r\\nwatched them for a few minutes, when suddenly the dwarf cried out—“The\\r\\ndawn, the dawn, my children; see, there is red in the sky. Come, be\\r\\nquick, see who will win Othmar’s gift before we go on our way.” When\\r\\nhe was silent all the singing girls approached Othmar, but before the\\r\\nothers came one who looked slighter and younger, and whose voice though\\r\\nas sweet was weaker.“See, Othmar,” she cried, “before we go on and leave you, let us try to\\r\\nsing one song together. Sing you as I do.” And Othmar sang with her as\\r\\nshe sang, in a clear voice like a bird’s—[Pg 156]And then ere the last notes had left Othmar’s mouth, she bent forward,\\r\\nand clasped him in her slender arms, and kissed him on the lips while\\r\\nstill they were open to sing.“Good-bye, Othmar,” cried she, “and that will be your last note for\\r\\nmany a long year, for surely you will have no need to sing after I am\\r\\ngone,” and at that all the strange folk standing near gave a laugh\\r\\nthat was more a chord of music than a laugh. And when her lips touched\\r\\nOthmar’s he quivered all over as a fiddle-string does when the bow is\\r\\ndrawn across it; and he gave a cry which was like the sweet sound of a\\r\\nbell.“Mine, mine!” cried the girl, as he fell back from her frightened. “Now\\r\\nmy voice will be the sweetest and best of all, for I have got Othmar’s\\r\\ntoo. No one will hear Othmar now,—Othmar who sang like the birds. And\\r\\nnever will he call the birds again, but I can sing as he sang, and all\\r\\nwho hear me will think that Othmar sings too. Rejoice, my sisters, sing\\r\\nand rejoice,” but at that moment the dwarf started up crying out—[Pg 157-8][Pg 159]“The dawn, the dawn, my children; see, the sun, the sun; beware, beware\\r\\nits rays.” Then came a great burst of sound like a chord from all the\\r\\nmusic folk, followed by a flash of light like lightning, and when it\\r\\nhad cleared away, the singing men and girls had gone, and in their\\r\\nplaces there lay upon the ground all the musical instruments—fiddles,\\r\\nviols, pipes, horns, and cymbals. Othmar stood staring as if he had\\r\\nbeen turned to stone, and watched as if he were in a dream, while the\\r\\nlittle man quietly packed the instruments on to the mule, and went away\\r\\nleading it by the bridle as he had come.“Good-bye, Othmar,” he called back, “good-bye. When you hear my fiddles\\r\\nagain, they will be sweeter than ever, for I have added your voice to\\r\\nthem.” And he went on his way over the hillside and disappeared beyond\\r\\nthe ridge. Othmar ran after him, but he stumbled and fell. He tried to\\r\\ncall out, but no voice would come! Tears ran down his cheeks, and he\\r\\nsobbed bitterly, but no sound came with the sobs, and he knew that his\\r\\nvoice had left him. The singing girl had stolen it, and he could never\\r\\nsing or cry out again!The sun was rising high in the heavens. The green lizards, slow-worms,\\r\\nfrogs and beetles were still ranged around, and gazed at Othmar with\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 160]\\r\\n\\r\\ntheir heads wonderingly on one side. The birds sang louder and louder,\\r\\nand their voices sounded sweet in the morning air. Othmar bent his head\\r\\nand wept because he knew that never could he call them to him again.\\r\\nThen from behind a bush there rose a big black raven, who cast a long\\r\\nshadow behind him which almost covered Othmar as he sat, and it gave a\\r\\ndeep croak and then spoke quite clearly—“Poor Othmar!” it said, “she has stolen your voice!” and he hopped\\r\\ndown. “You will never speak nor sing again. Poor Othmar!—ah! they\\r\\nstole my voice too; once I could sing far better than the birds you\\r\\nhear now. That was thousands of years ago, but the dwarf came to my\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 161]\\r\\n\\r\\nnest, and told me if I would go with him he would teach me how to\\r\\nwhistle so that the worms should rise out of the ground and jump into\\r\\nmy mouth when they heard me, and he called one of his trumpet-men\\r\\nto teach me—one you saw dance—and he bid me lay my beak below his\\r\\nlips while he sang; then he stole my voice, all but a croak, which he\\r\\ndid not want because it was so harsh, but all your voice was sweet,\\r\\ntherefore she has got it all—poor Othmar, poor Othmar!”Then Othmar raised himself, with the tears running from his eyes, and\\r\\nturned to find his way back to the village. It seemed a long distance,\\r\\nfor he missed his path, and it was near nightfall before he saw the\\r\\ntops of the cottages and his own little home; but as he neared the\\r\\nvillage, he could see Hulda standing in the road, shading her eyes from\\r\\nthe sun, and watching the way he came.“Othmar,” she cried when she saw him, “is it you? I have been to search\\r\\nfor you far and near, and there are others now looking for you, for we\\r\\nwere afraid lest you had fallen down some crevice, or slipped over the\\r\\nrocks.”Othmar came up to her, and put out his hand, and she saw how pale he\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 162]\\r\\n\\r\\nwas, and that his eyes were full of tears, but he said nothing.“Othmar, tell me,” cried Hulda; “what has happened? why don’t you\\r\\nspeak?” but still Othmar was silent. “Are you hurt, Othmar? Did the\\r\\ndwarf do you any harm?”Then Othmar flung himself on the ground, and began to sob, but his sobs\\r\\ngave no sound, though the ground was wet with his tears, and Hulda knew\\r\\nthat Othmar was dumb.“Poor Othmar, poor Othmar!” croaked the raven who had kept close to\\r\\nOthmar, and flew overhead, but Hulda did not understand it, only she\\r\\nwept to see his grief.“Never fear, Othmar,” she said tenderly, “your voice will soon come\\r\\nback; it was the long cold night, and the fear that has driven it away.\\r\\nCome home with me, and let me nurse you, and you shall soon be well.”Othmar shook his head, and the tears fell from his eyes, but he let her\\r\\ntake his hand and lead him into the village where his old mother sat\\r\\nand waited for him; but still, although she sprang forward to greet\\r\\nhim, and put her arms around his neck, he could not speak, and his deep\\r\\nsobs gave no sound. At first the villagers said he was ill, and soon\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 163]\\r\\n\\r\\nhe would be well again, but as the days passed and he never spoke, they\\r\\nknew that he was struck dumb. Some said it was the cold, and some that\\r\\nhe had been frightened; only Hulda said to herself, “it was the wicked\\r\\nlittle man.”So the days passed, and Othmar remained silent and worked with the\\r\\nother young men of the village without speaking, and no longer could\\r\\nhe sing or call the birds to him. Always he looked white and sad,\\r\\nbut saddest of all when there was any village merry-making, and the\\r\\nvillagers sang and danced together. Then when he heard them he would\\r\\nput his fingers in his ears and hide his eyes so as not to see them and\\r\\nrun afar off by himself; for the sound of any music was quite horrible\\r\\nto him after the singing of the travelling musicians. So a year passed,\\r\\nand Othmar never spoke, and instead of calling him the bird-boy, the\\r\\nvillage people called him “dumb Othmar.”It was midsummer-night, and the villagers had been having a\\r\\nmerry-making and dancing cheerily on the green in the village. Othmar\\r\\nwas not with them; he had left the village and went and sat apart on\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 164]\\r\\n\\r\\nthe top of a rocky hill, from where afar the sea could be seen when the\\r\\nweather was clear. The moon was wonderfully bright, and the country\\r\\nwas almost as light as by day. Othmar could hear the sound of their\\r\\nlaughter, but he never laughed, and as he sat with his head bowed upon\\r\\nhis knees he wept silently. So he remained alone till far into the\\r\\nnight when all the singing and dancing was done, and the villagers had\\r\\ngone home, but just when the clocks struck twelve he saw Hulda, who\\r\\ncame slowly to him, and he saw that she too was crying.“Othmar,” she said, “I have thought and thought, and I know that the\\r\\nlittle man with the fiddles was a wicked fairy.” Othmar nodded. “So I\\r\\nam going into the big world to find him, for if he has done you this\\r\\nill he will know how to cure you, and I have saved all my money for a\\r\\nyear.”Then Othmar took her hand, and kissed it, but still wept, as he shook\\r\\nhis head and made signs to her that she must not go, as it would be all\\r\\nin vain. But Hulda did not heed him.[Pg 165]“And now,” she said, “I am going, Othmar, and it may be long years\\r\\nbefore I return, so you must do three things. First, you must give me\\r\\na long curl of your brown hair, that I may lay it next my heart and\\r\\nwear it day and night, not to forget you. Then you must kiss me on my\\r\\nlips to say good-bye; and then you must promise that my name shall be\\r\\nthe first words your lips say when they again can speak.” Then Othmar\\r\\ntook his knife and cut from his head the longest, brightest curl of his\\r\\nhair, and drew her to him and kissed her thrice upon the lips, and then\\r\\nhe took her hand and with it wrote upon his lips her name, “Hulda,” as\\r\\na promise that her name should be the first thing they said.“Good-bye, Othmar,” she said; “you will wait for me.” Then she turned\\r\\naway and started alone to go down the mountain-side, and she looked\\r\\nback as she went and called back, “Good-bye, Othmar,” as long as he\\r\\ncould see or hear her.She went straight down the hill and journeyed for a long way, till the\\r\\ndawn began to show red in the sky, and she lay under a tree and slept\\r\\nsoundly till the sun had risen and woke her.She sat and thought which way she should go. “I must seek out some\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 166]\\r\\n\\r\\nwise man who knows about fairies and wicked witches,” she said to\\r\\nherself, “and who will tell me where to search. And I will ask every\\r\\none I meet where the wisest person is to be found.” So she went on for\\r\\nmany days till she came to a tiny village, outside which, in a field,\\r\\nshe saw a shepherd minding sheep. Hulda stopped and asked if he could\\r\\ntell her where she could find a very wise man who could answer her\\r\\nquestion.The shepherd thought a bit, and then he said, “The wisest man in these\\r\\nparts lives up in the little cottage on the other side of the village.\\r\\nHe cured my sheep two years back when all the flock were sick and many\\r\\ndied—a little cottage with a red gate.” Hulda thanked the shepherd,\\r\\nand went on till she came to the little cottage with the red gate. When\\r\\nshe had knocked at the door a tall man came out, and she asked him if\\r\\n’twas he who had cured the shepherd’s sheep, and as he was so clever,\\r\\nif he would tell her what to do. She told him she wanted to find a\\r\\ndwarf who led a donkey covered with musical instruments, and whom she\\r\\nknew to be a wicked sorcerer, since he struck folk dumb.[Pg 167]The tall man looked at her and said, “My business is to cure sheep,\\r\\ncows, and horses, and I know it right well; but I know nothing of\\r\\ndwarfs and witches, and how can I tell you which way he has gone, or\\r\\nanything about him?”“Then of whom had I best ask?” said Hulda. “Tell me who is the wisest\\r\\nand most learned man in these parts, and I will go to him.”The tall man rubbed his head and considered. “I suppose,” quoth he,\\r\\n“that the old school-master at the village school yonder would be said\\r\\nto be the most learned man hereabouts, for he teaches the children\\r\\nall sorts of things that they forget when they grow up. That is the\\r\\nschool-house on the hill.” So on went Hulda again to the school.As she came near she could hear the children calling out their lessons,\\r\\nand their master, who was an old priest, teaching them. So she waited\\r\\nabout till school hours were over, and the children had all come out,\\r\\nand then she timidly went in and curtseyed to the old school-master,\\r\\nand told him her tale, and asked him, as he was so very learned, if he\\r\\nwould advise her what to do; but instead of answering her the old man\\r\\nat first stared at her in bewilderment, and then he said, “I can teach\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 168]\\r\\n\\r\\nyou to read and write and many wonderful things, but of dwarfs who can\\r\\nsteal a boy’s voice I know nothing. You would do best not to think more\\r\\nof it.”“But some one there must be,” cried Hulda, beginning to cry, “who can\\r\\ntell me what to do, and which way to go. For I am sure that the old man\\r\\nwas a fairy, and if so, no living man can help Othmar, but only he who\\r\\ndid the mischief can undo it.”The old priest looked at her sadly and shook his head. “My child,”\\r\\nhe said, “this is a foolish talk about fairies and sorcerers, I know\\r\\nnothing of such things. It is only untaught folk and fools who give\\r\\nheed to such matters.”“To untaught folk and fools then I must go, for surely they can help\\r\\nme more than the wise,” she cried. So she left the school-house, and\\r\\nstarted again through the little village street. The first person\\r\\nshe met was a baker going home after taking round his bread, and she\\r\\nstopped him and asked him who was the most ignorant and foolish person\\r\\nin those parts.The baker stood and stared at her, and seemed to be half angry. At\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 169]\\r\\n\\r\\nlast he said, “I am sure I don’t know anything about fools. You had\\r\\nbetter go on to the cake-maker, who lives a mile up the hill. He is,\\r\\nto my mind, the biggest fool in these parts.” And tossing his basket\\r\\nabout and seeming to be much offended, he went his way. Hulda went on\\r\\nfor a mile up the hill, and there she found a little group of cottages,\\r\\nand in their midst was a shop with an open oven, and she could see its\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 170]\\r\\n\\r\\nowner busy making cakes and sweets. Hulda went in and bought a cake,\\r\\nand as she sat and ate it, she asked the man timidly if he knew many\\r\\nof the people in that neighbourhood, and if any were very ignorant and\\r\\nfoolish.“Indeed,” cried the man, “you may well ask that. Why, a more silly,\\r\\nignorant set of folk I never knew, quite different from the people in\\r\\nmy native town, but that is miles away.”“And who do you think the silliest then?” asked Hulda.“Why, for sure ’tis hard to say,” said the man, scratching his head.\\r\\n“They’re such a poor silly lot, right away from the Mayor down to Tommy\\r\\nthe fool.”“And who is Tommy the fool?” asked Hulda eagerly.“’Tis a poor natural-born idiot who lives with his mother in the little\\r\\ncabin on the side of the common. He spends all his time trying to catch\\r\\na bird, and he never has caught one, and never will.”“Thank you for telling me about him,” said Hulda, rising to go away.\\r\\n“Maybe if he is really a fool he could answer my questions as they\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 171]\\r\\n\\r\\nsay,” and she went on again with a lighter heart. At last she came to\\r\\nthe common on which the fool lived with his mother. When she approached\\r\\nthe little cabin, she saw some one dancing about in front of an oak,\\r\\ndressed up with the feathers of birds and fowls, which looked as if\\r\\nthey had been picked up from the ground. He was a young man of about\\r\\neighteen, and he had a cheerful face, but any one looking at him could\\r\\nsee at once he was an idiot. He was dancing round the tree and pointing\\r\\nup to the birds, and calling them to come down to him. Hulda came up\\r\\nand stood quite close and watched him, as he ran round smiling and\\r\\ngiggling. Then she said, “Please can you tell me where I shall find a\\r\\nlittle man, a dwarf who drives a donkey covered with pipes and fiddles?”The fool looked at her very gravely, but he said nothing; so then she\\r\\nwent on to tell him how the little man had come to their village, and\\r\\nhow he had stolen Othmar’s voice, and how she had come out to seek it.\\r\\nJust as she finished speaking, there rose from the ground a raven,\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 172]\\r\\n\\r\\nand soared above their heads. When he saw it the fool pointed to it,\\r\\nand cried out, “The raven, the raven, follow the raven,” and as the\\r\\nraven flew, he ran after him with Hulda following in turn. They ran\\r\\nfor a long way, the fool leaping and bounding, and pointing with his\\r\\nfinger and crying, “The raven, the raven, do what the raven does.” Then\\r\\nsuddenly he turned, giving a wild laugh, and began to run home again,\\r\\nbut as he went he nodded and called to Hulda, “Follow the raven, follow\\r\\nit, do what the raven does.”Hulda felt inclined to burst into tears with disappointment, but still\\r\\nshe ran meekly after the bird, murmuring to herself, “He said follow\\r\\nthe raven, but what good can that do me?” But when the fool had turned\\r\\nback, the raven slackened his pace, and cawed and lighted on a tree,\\r\\nand Hulda, panting for breath, sat down under it, and looked up at it.“Poor Hulda!” it croaked, but she couldn’t understand it; “poor Hulda,\\r\\ncome with me, and I will show you where the dwarf is.” Then it began to\\r\\nfly slowly on again.“What shall I do?” sobbed Hulda. “He was only an idiot, he knew\\r\\nnothing; still he told me to follow the raven, and no one else has\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 173]\\r\\n\\r\\ntold me anything;” so on she went, and this time the raven flew quite\\r\\nslowly, so that Hulda kept up with it walking. On they travelled till\\r\\nevening was well advanced, into all sorts of places where Hulda had\\r\\nnever been, and through many villages. Then it began to grow dark, and\\r\\nthe moon came out, but still they travelled on. Hulda was foot-sore and\\r\\nweary, but she would not give up, and said to herself, “It was what the\\r\\nfool said, ‘Follow the raven, do what the raven does!’”Just before dawn, they came out on to a big plain, where there were\\r\\nneither houses nor trees, but in the far distance you could see a long\\r\\nline of mountains; a little further in the centre of the plain Hulda\\r\\nsaw a little dark mass, and straight to this the raven flew, and as\\r\\nHulda approached it, she saw that it was the little dwarf, lying asleep\\r\\nupon the ground beside his heap of musical instruments, with the mule\\r\\ngrazing near. “Oh, good wise fool,” cried Hulda, “now indeed you have\\r\\ngiven me the best advice. Since the raven has led me to the wicked\\r\\ndwarf, now indeed will I do what the raven does, whatever it be.”The raven flew on, and lit upon a scrubby bush, a little way from\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 174]\\r\\n\\r\\nthe sleeping dwarf, and Hulda followed and crouched beside it, making\\r\\nno noise lest she should disturb the sleeper, and hiding behind the\\r\\nbranches so that she could not be seen. Presently the little man\\r\\nrose from the ground, and called out, “Come, my children, practice,\\r\\npractice; the dawn is here, and the sun will rise, and then we must go\\r\\nupon our way.”Then Hulda saw what Othmar had seen before. The pipes raised themselves\\r\\nfrom the ground, and untwisted, and became tall, lithe men; some\\r\\ngradually uncurled themselves, and put forth long arms and became\\r\\nbeautiful girls, till each instrument had taken the likeness of a human\\r\\nbeing. Then they began to dance and to sing, and Hulda watched them\\r\\nas Othmar had watched them, and she too felt as if she had never seen\\r\\nand heard anything so beautiful in her life, and she longed to rush to\\r\\nthem, but she heard the raven croak above her, and remembered the words\\r\\nof the fool, “The raven, the raven, do what the raven does.” Then she\\r\\nsaw that the raven had hopped off the tree, and was standing upon the\\r\\nearth in front of her, and was beginning to dig in the earth with its\\r\\nlong beak, as if it would find a worm. “The fool said, Do what the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 175]\\r\\n\\r\\nraven does, so must I dig too,” thought she, and she began to scoop the\\r\\nbrown earth with her hand, till she had made a hole, watching the raven\\r\\nall the time.Presently she saw that the raven had found a long worm, and held it by\\r\\nits throat in the air, but it did not swallow it. Hulda looked into her\\r\\nhole to see if there was a worm there also, and at the bottom she saw\\r\\nlying a long, lithe, green snake, twisted up and apparently torpid.\\r\\n“Surely,” thought Hulda, “if I do what the raven does, I shall take\\r\\nthis out,” and she put her hand into the hole, and grasped the snake\\r\\nby its throat, though she was very much afraid of it, and then she\\r\\ncrouched down behind the raven and the bush.“Come,” cried the dwarf, when they had all sung together, “now let us\\r\\nhear the last new voice. Othmar’s voice was as sweet as silver. Now\\r\\nlet me hear how my youngest daughter has treated it.” Then there came\\r\\nto the front the youngest and fairest of the girls, and began to sing,\\r\\nand when she heard it, Hulda could scarcely keep from screaming, for\\r\\nshe recognized that the tones were Othmar’s; but just as the singing\\r\\nsounded the sweetest, the raven with a croak opened his mouth, and\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 176]\\r\\n\\r\\ndropped the worm upon the ground, and Hulda let go her hold of the\\r\\nbright green snake, which darted through the short grass towards the\\r\\ndancers.There arose from all sides the cry of “A snake, a snake!” and they\\r\\nseemed panic-stricken. The snake glided straight towards the singing\\r\\ngirl, and deftly coiled itself round her ankles, while from the old\\r\\nman and all the others came a terrible uproar, but the snake from the\\r\\ngirl’s ankles had slid up her body in bright green coils, and then\\r\\ntwisted itself around her throat, and coiled tighter and tighter and\\r\\ntighter, till her head fell over on one side. Then Hulda heard a noise\\r\\nlike the sighing of wind, but sweet and tender, while the dwarf and all\\r\\nthe singers were in a hubbub and confusion.For a moment the old man stood motionless, then he rose and gave a\\r\\nterrible cry. Hulda trembled when she heard his voice, it sounded like\\r\\nnothing earthly, but ere he was silent there had risen from the ground\\r\\nand from the bushes near a number of little cloudy forms, black and\\r\\nthick, and twirling in all directions, and they twisted in and out\\r\\namong the singers; and as they twisted among them, they ceased to be\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 177]\\r\\n\\r\\nmen and women, but became musical instruments, as they had been before,\\r\\nall save the girl around whose neck the snake had wound, and who seemed\\r\\nto shrivel and shrivel in its coils till she was no more to be seen.In less than a minute they were all packed again upon the mule, and the\\r\\nlittle old man was leading it quietly away, as if nothing had happened.\\r\\nAnd upon the grass lay the glittering snake, though all trace of the\\r\\ngirl around whose neck it had twisted had gone. Hulda ran to it, and\\r\\nthen she almost cried, for she feared that after all the girl with\\r\\nOthmar’s voice had escaped her. But she remembered the words of Tommy\\r\\nthe fool, “Do as the raven does; follow the raven,” and looking up\\r\\nshe saw that the raven was fluttering above her, with the worm it had\\r\\npicked up from the ground in its mouth.“Oh, dear raven,” cried Hulda, “you brought me to where the little man\\r\\nwas, now lead me back and show me what to do next.” And mindful of the\\r\\nfool’s advice, she picked up the snake, and holding it firmly by the\\r\\nthroat, turned to follow the raven, who flew ahead of her. Thus they\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 178]\\r\\n\\r\\njourneyed back, over the same country through which Hulda had come\\r\\nbefore. All looked just the same, but Hulda was sorely tired, for she\\r\\nhad now been walking many days, and she felt sad, for she did not know\\r\\nif after all she had gained anything, or whether she ought not to have\\r\\nfollowed the little old man, and though she had heard Othmar’s voice,\\r\\nshe did not know how she was to get it back to him. “Never mind,” she\\r\\nsaid to herself, “the fool told me right so far, and evidently he knew\\r\\nall about it, so I had best keep to his advice.”The sun rose high in the sky and the day was very hot, and poor Hulda\\r\\nlonged to lie down under the trees and sleep; moreover the snake in her\\r\\nhand twisted and twisted, till she could scarce hold it. Sometimes she\\r\\ncried from very weariness, but still the raven flew in front of her.\\r\\nShe had bought dry bread as she came along, and when the raven stopped\\r\\nand hopped upon the ground, she munched it to stave off her hunger,\\r\\nbut directly the raven began to fly she followed it, and she never let\\r\\nthe snake from her grasp. The sun had set, and dark was all over the\\r\\nland ere she came to the village where the fool lived, but no fool was\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 179]\\r\\n\\r\\nthere to be seen. Hulda sought everywhere, but she could not find him.\\r\\nThen she saw that the raven had stopped and settled on the roof of the\\r\\ncottage where the fool lived, and, standing on one leg, had gone to\\r\\nsleep with its head under its wing, so Hulda lay down by the side of\\r\\nthe door, and laying her head on a stone rested too. But first she took\\r\\noff her girdle and tied it firmly round the snake’s throat, and then\\r\\ntied it round her waist again lest she should fall asleep and the snake\\r\\nglide away.Just when the stars were beginning to look pale, and as there were\\r\\nsigns of the dawn in the sky, the door of the cottage opened, and out\\r\\nthere came the fool, dressed up as Hulda had seen him before, with\\r\\nfeathers and weeds and bits of bright rag. Hulda started up, and he\\r\\nlaughed when he saw her. “Look,” he said, “the sun is rising; I am come\\r\\nout to see it.”“I have come back,” cried Hulda, “and I have seen them all—the old\\r\\nman and the musician girls, and the one who stole Othmar’s voice will\\r\\nnever use it again, for this snake has throttled her; but what am I to\\r\\ndo now? How can I give him back his voice? What shall I do to make him\\r\\nspeak?” And as she spoke she took the snake from her bosom and showed\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 180]\\r\\n\\r\\nit to the fool. He looked at it very gravely as he always did when\\r\\nanything was shown to him, and looked very wise and nodded. “It is a\\r\\nsnake,” he said; “perhaps Othmar will like the snake.”Hulda begged him to tell her if he knew what she should do, but he\\r\\nwould say no more, but began to dance and sing as she had seen him do\\r\\nbefore. Then at last Hulda burst out crying, “He is nothing but a poor\\r\\nidiot,” she said, “and I have been on a fool’s errand when I did as he\\r\\ntold me, though I did see the wicked little man, and this snake did\\r\\npunish the singing girl, so I will take it back to Othmar that he may\\r\\nsee I have tried. But now I believe he will be dumb for ever.”And she took the snake and looked at it as she held it. It was very\\r\\nstill, and seemed half torpid, though the weather was warm. She saw it\\r\\nwas not a common snake, for it was bright brown, and green with odd\\r\\nmarkings, and it glittered oddly when the sun’s rays touched it.“I will go back now,” said Hulda; “I will go back to Othmar, and tell\\r\\nhim I have failed, and ask him to forgive my vanity in thinking\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 181]\\r\\n\\r\\nI could help him. I will go back at once and tell him all.” And\\r\\noverhead the raven croaked and told her to go quickly, but she did not\\r\\nunderstand what he said.So again she began to trudge on, holding the snake in her hands and\\r\\ntoiling over fields and moors in the way that she knew led to her own\\r\\nlittle village, though by now her feet were so swollen and her legs so\\r\\nstiff that she almost cried for pain.Presently she came to the village where the cake-maker lived, and as\\r\\nshe passed his shop, she saw that he stood at the door and nodded to\\r\\nher as he saw her coming.“Good-day,” he cried; “you are the young wench I saw go past awhile\\r\\nback.”“Yes, I am going home now,” said Hulda.“And have you found your fiddles and horns that turned to men and\\r\\nwomen?” he asked. “It was a fool’s errand, I fear, you were going on;\\r\\nand what have you got in your hand now?”“It is a snake,” answered Hulda, “and——”“A snake!” screamed the cake-maker. “Lord love the girl, is she mad to\\r\\ngo wandering over the country carrying a snake with her? Why, it might\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 182]\\r\\n\\r\\nkill you, wench! Drop it at once!”“No, indeed, I will not drop it,” said Hulda, “for it seems to me that\\r\\nit is the only thing which may do Othmar good, for at any rate it has\\r\\nkilled the girl who stole his voice, and——”At this the man started and called out, “Good Lord, she is clean off\\r\\nher head. Stolen Othmar’s voice! What can the wench mean? Why, girl,\\r\\nthat snake might bite you, and you would be dead at once. Why on earth\\r\\nshould you carry it because it has killed a girl?”“I am carrying it because the fool told me to do what the raven does,”\\r\\nanswered Hulda, “and he has still a worm in his mouth. Look.”At this the man burst out laughing. “Why, what has that to do with\\r\\nyou?” he cried; “a raven will often carry a worm for a bit. Drop this\\r\\nsnake at once, you silly lass, or, better still, hold it firm while I\\r\\ncrush its head with my poker.” And he seized the poker to kill it with.Then Hulda was frightened lest he might steal the snake from her, or\\r\\nkill it by force, and she ran on; but she ran in such haste that she\\r\\nstumbled against the baker who was just coming out from his shop with\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 183]\\r\\n\\r\\nhis basket of loaves on his arm.“Can’t you look where you are going?” he cried in anger, as he picked\\r\\nup the bread which had rolled into the road; and then, seeing it was\\r\\nHulda, he said:—“Why, who are you running away from, my girl? Are you\\r\\non the look-out for more fools that you can’t see when an honest man\\r\\ncomes along? And whatever have you got there?”“It is only a snake I have found,” said Hulda, when she had asked the\\r\\nman’s pardon, and she tried to hide the snake in her skirt, but the\\r\\nbaker seized her arm and made her show it to him.“What on earth are you carrying a live snake with you for?” he asked.\\r\\n“Don’t you know they are venomous beasts, and the bite of one is\\r\\ncertain death?” And, like the cake-maker, he tried to wrench the snake\\r\\nfrom her. At this Hulda was terribly frightened.“If they take the snake from me,” she thought, “then my last chance is\\r\\ngone,” and she tried to free herself from the baker, but he seized her\\r\\nby the skirt and held her fast, and shouted out to others to come and\\r\\nhelp him.[Pg 184]“Help, help!” he cried. “Here is a poor mad girl, and she has got hold\\r\\nof a poisonous adder, and she will let it loose in the village and it\\r\\nwill bite some of our children and kill them.” And when they heard his\\r\\ncry the villagers all came running out of their cottages.“Let me go, let me go,” shrieked Hulda, “it will do no harm. I will\\r\\nhold it tight, and I would not lose it for the wide world.”“I tell you she is mad,” roared the baker, and the cake-maker came up\\r\\nand said the same thing. “She wandered by here some time back, and all\\r\\nshe wanted to know was where she could find another as mad as herself,\\r\\nbut she will have far to go before she meets one, I reckon. We must\\r\\nsecure her and take the snake from her, but beware how you catch it,\\r\\nfor fear it should bite.”And the people all gathered round her and made a great hubbub, though\\r\\nthey were afraid to touch the snake which Hulda still held firmly in\\r\\nher hand. And they made such a din that the old school-master came out\\r\\nof the school-house with his pupils after him.The people told him there was a poor mad girl who had got a snake, and\\r\\nwould not let them take it from her, and he remembered Hulda as the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 185]\\r\\n\\r\\nothers had done, and shook his head and said sadly, “I fear it is too\\r\\ntrue. The poor child is really mad, but we cannot wrench the snake from\\r\\nher lest it may turn and bite us. But it is certain that it would not\\r\\nbe safe to let her go; so, as the children are all going home now, let\\r\\nus lock her into the school-house here, till we can get something to\\r\\nkill the creature with, and then when the doctor comes, he can see if\\r\\nthe poor girl is very bad, and what had better be done with her.”Hulda turned quite white with fear, and cried out that she was not mad,\\r\\nand that the snake should harm no one, but they would not heed her,\\r\\nand pushed her into the school-house, and bolted the doors on her, and\\r\\nthere Hulda sat on the floor and cried as if her heart would break.“Alas!” cried she, “now all hope is gone, and Othmar will be dumb for\\r\\never. For what good have I carried this snake with me all this way, if\\r\\nnow it is to be taken from me and killed?” and her tears fell on the\\r\\nviper as she looked at it in her hand. It was very bright green and\\r\\nyellow, and it kept wrinkling and twisting its skin as she grasped\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 186]\\r\\n\\r\\nit, and making a loud hissing noise. As her tears were still falling\\r\\nshe heard a croak over her head, and saw the raven perched on a window\\r\\nabove her, and again her hopes revived.“Maybe he has come to help me,” she thought, “for I should never have\\r\\nfound the little dwarf if it had not been for the raven.” Then as she\\r\\nlooked up at the raven sitting in the window, she saw that it was\\r\\npecking at a piece of rope that hung through the window, and Hulda\\r\\nthought—“Surely if I could climb up to the window, I could scramble\\r\\nthrough it, and climb down the rope on to the ground. Only if they were\\r\\nto see me, they would catch me again, so I must wait till nightfall\\r\\nwhen there is no one there.”So she sat down again and waited till the sun had set, and she trembled\\r\\nat every noise lest it might be some one coming to seek her, but they\\r\\nleft her alone, and no one came. When it was quite dark, and all the\\r\\nvillage was quiet she went to the window, and tried to climb up to it,\\r\\nbut she found that she could not manage to get up on to the window-sill\\r\\nwhile she held the snake in her hand. Then first she thought she would\\r\\nwind it around her waist, but she remembered how it had tightened\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 187]\\r\\n\\r\\naround the singing girl and killed her, and for some time she could\\r\\nnot think what to do with it. At last she twisted it into a knot, and\\r\\nplaced it in her bosom, though she trembled lest it should bite her.\\r\\nAnd when she placed it in her bosom, she saw the curl of Othmar’s hair\\r\\nthat lay there, and she took it and tied up the snake’s jaws with it so\\r\\nthat it might not open its mouth. “For Othmar’s hair will not break or\\r\\ngive way,” she said; “it is like his heart, it will be true and strong\\r\\ntill the end.”Then she climbed up on to the window-ledge, and scrambled through the\\r\\nwindow, and took the piece of rope and let herself down on to the\\r\\nground outside. And when she lit upon the ground, she heard the raven\\r\\ncroaking above her, and her heart leapt for joy, and she began to run\\r\\nas fast as she could to get away from the village lest they might catch\\r\\nher again.When she came again into the open country, she looked for the raven,\\r\\nand saw that it was flying in front of her as before, towards the\\r\\ndistant mountains where she knew lay her home. She toiled on, for many\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 188]\\r\\n\\r\\ndays, but by now the summer had nearly passed away, and when she got\\r\\ninto the high mountain land, she found that the cold winter had given\\r\\nsigns of coming, and the trees were beginning to be bare, and there was\\r\\na light white frost on the ground. It was far into the night when she\\r\\narrived in the village, and the villagers were all asleep and their\\r\\ncottages shut. Outside the cottage where Othmar lived grew a big old\\r\\nivy tree, and on this the raven perched, and underneath it Hulda lay\\r\\ndown to wait the dawn and Othmar’s waking. She lay quiet for a bit,\\r\\nbut when she saw a faint glimmering of light where the sun was going\\r\\nto rise, she felt she could be still no longer, and she sprang up and\\r\\ncalled, “Othmar, come down, I am here,” for she dreaded having to tell\\r\\nhim before the other villagers that she had failed.In a few moments the door of the cottage opened and Othmar came out,\\r\\nand ran to greet her, but she kept afar.“Othmar,” she cried, “I have done you no good, save that I have\\r\\npunished the wicked girl who took your voice. This snake killed her, so\\r\\nshe will never sing as you did again. See.” And she held out the snake\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 189]\\r\\n\\r\\nto him; it was curled round and still tied up with his hair, and as the\\r\\nsun began to shine it glittered brightly.“But I have done you no good, indeed rather harm,” Hulda went on, “for\\r\\nI have made you hope where there was no hope, and you have waited and\\r\\nexpected that I should bring you back what you had lost, and I have not\\r\\ndone it, and now I shall never hear you say my name ‘Hulda’ again,” and\\r\\nshe wept so bitterly that the tears fell from her face, and dropped\\r\\nupon the snake which still she grasped. Othmar held out his hand, and\\r\\ntried to take her hand that he might kiss it, and as he did so, he\\r\\ntouched the snake’s long tail, and it began to writhe and twist, and\\r\\nglisten more and more as the sun shone on it. And as he raised her hand\\r\\nto his mouth, Othmar tried to say her name “Hulda” with his poor dumb\\r\\nlips that could make no sound, and he breathed it on the snake, and it\\r\\nseemed as if the snake vibrated with the name, and suddenly it swelled\\r\\nand swelled, and shone still more brightly, and its mouth grew wide and\\r\\nburst Othmar’s hair which had bound it, and widened out till it was not\\r\\na snake any more, but a curled golden trumpet, curled up as the snake\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 190]\\r\\n\\r\\nhad been, and like that which had been changed into the singing girl\\r\\nwho stole Othmar’s voice. “Take it, Othmar, and blow,” cried Hulda,\\r\\nand he put it to his lips and cried “Hulda!” and Hulda heard her name\\r\\nechoing back in a burst of music from all around. At its sound the\\r\\nbirds awoke in all the trees, and began their morning chorus, and the\\r\\nvillage folk ran to their windows to see what the trumpet’s peal had\\r\\nbeen, and saw Othmar standing with Hulda in his arms, and at their feet\\r\\nthe bright trumpet which he had dropped. It lay on the ground, but as\\r\\nOthmar began to speak and to say, “Hulda, Hulda, you have brought it\\r\\nback, you have given me my voice again,” the trumpet broke into many\\r\\npieces, and with every word crumbled, till there was nothing left but\\r\\na little heap of shining golden sand, and from under it there glided\\r\\nout a dark green snake with yellow markings, and it slid away into the\\r\\nbushes and disappeared.Then all the villagers rejoiced, and Hulda wept with happiness. And\\r\\nOthmar married Hulda, and his voice never left him again; but when\\r\\nlong years after folk would tell him his voice was sweet and far more\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 191]\\r\\n\\r\\nbeautiful than the birds, he would say, “But it is not really my voice,\\r\\nit is my wife’s, Hulda’s, for I should have been dumb for ever if she\\r\\nhad not sought it and brought it back to me.”[Pg 192]\\nOnce upon a time there lived a shepherd and his wife, who lived in\\r\\na very lonely little cottage far from town or village, near some\\r\\nmountains. It was a wild neighbourhood, and the wind blew across the\\r\\nmountains fiercely, and the rain often fell so heavily that it seemed\\r\\nas if the cottage would be washed away. One evening when the shepherd\\r\\nwas out, there came on a great storm of rain which beat against the\\r\\ndoors and the windows violently. As the shepherd’s wife sat listening\\r\\nto it by the fire, it seemed to her as if it sounded louder than she\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 193]\\r\\n\\r\\nhad ever heard it before, and the raindrops sounded like the knock of\\r\\na hand that was knocking to gain admittance. It went on for a little\\r\\ntime, till the shepherd’s wife could bear to listen to it no longer,\\r\\nand she rose and went to the door to open it, though she knew that\\r\\nshe would let the wind and rain into the room. As she opened the door\\r\\na gust of rain was blown in her face, and then she saw that in the\\r\\ndoorway stood a woman who had been knocking. She was a tall woman\\r\\nwrapped in a grey cloak with long hair falling down her back. “Thank\\r\\nyou,” she said. And though her voice was very low, the shepherd’s wife\\r\\ncould hear it plainly through all the storm. “Thank you for opening the\\r\\ndoor to me. Many would have let me stand outside. Now may I come into\\r\\nyour cottage and rest?”“How wet you must be!” cried the shepherd’s wife; “come in and rest,\\r\\nand let me give you food. Have you come from far?”“No, I come from quite near,” said the woman, and she came into the\\r\\ncottage as she spoke, and sat down in a chair near the door. “And I\\r\\nwant no food, only a glass of water. I must go on directly, but I have\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 194]\\r\\n\\r\\nnot far to go, and I shall be no wetter than I am now.”The shepherd’s wife stared in surprise, for she saw that apparently\\r\\nthe woman’s clothes were not wet at all. And what was stranger still,\\r\\nthough she had thought she was only clad in a dull grey cloak, now she\\r\\nsaw that she was covered with jewellery,—clear stones, like diamonds\\r\\nwith many flashing colours; and she also saw that all her clothes were\\r\\nof the finest. She gave her a glass of water, and begged that as well\\r\\nshe might give her other food, but the woman shook her head, and said\\r\\nno, water was all she needed. When she had drunk the water she gave\\r\\nback the glass to the shepherd’s wife, and said, “And so this is your\\r\\nhome. Have you all that you want in life? Are you happy?”“Ay, we are happy enough,” said the shepherd’s wife, “save indeed for\\r\\none thing. Ten years ago my little baby girl died, and I have no other\\r\\nchildren. I long for one sorely, that I might take care of it and make\\r\\nit happy, while it is little, and then in turn, when I am old, it would\\r\\nlove and care for me.”“And if you had a little child,” said the woman, rising up and\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 195]\\r\\n\\r\\nstanding before the shepherd’s wife, “you think you would really love\\r\\nit better than anything in the world. Many women say that, but few do\\r\\nit. Before long a little child will be born to you, and as long as you\\r\\nlove it better than anything in the world it will remain with you, but\\r\\nwhen you love anything else better than your little daughter and her\\r\\nhappiness, it will go from you; so remember my words. Good-bye,” and\\r\\nthe woman walked to the door and went quietly out into the rain, and\\r\\nthe shepherd’s wife saw her disappearing, and the rain pelting around\\r\\nher, but her clothes were not blown about, neither did the rain seem to\\r\\nwet her.A year passed away, and the shepherd’s wife had a tiny daughter, a\\r\\nlovely little baby with the bluest eyes and the softest skin; the\\r\\nevening she was born the wind howled and the rain fell as fiercely as\\r\\non the night when the grey woman had come into the shepherd’s cottage.\\r\\nThe shepherd and his wife both loved their little daughter very dearly,\\r\\nas well they might, as no fairer child was ever seen. But as she grew\\r\\nolder, some things about her frightened her mother, and she had some\\r\\nways of which she could not cure her.[Pg 196]She would never go near a fire, however cold she was, neither did\\r\\nshe love the sunshine, but always ran from it and crept into the shade;\\r\\nbut when she heard the rain pattering against the window-panes she\\r\\nwould cry, “Listen, mother, listen to my brothers and sisters dancing,”\\r\\nand then she would begin to dance too in the cottage, her little feet\\r\\npattering upon the boards; or, if she possibly could, she would run\\r\\nout on to the moor and dance, with the rain falling upon her, and her\\r\\nmother had much ado to get her to come back into the cottage, yet she\\r\\nnever seemed to get very wet, nor did she catch cold.[Pg 197]A river ran near the cottage, and by it she would go\\r\\nand sit for hours dabbling her feet in the water, and singing sweet\\r\\nlittle songs to herself.Still, in all other ways she was a good,\\r\\naffectionate girl, and did all that her mother told her, and seemed\\r\\nto love both her parents tenderly, and the shepherd’s wife would say\\r\\nto herself, “My only trouble is that when she is grown up, she will\\r\\nwant to marry, and leave me, and I shall have to do without her.” Time\\r\\npassed, and the old shepherd died, but his wife and daughter still\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 198]\\r\\n\\r\\nlived on in the little cottage, and the daughter grew to be a most\\r\\nbeautiful young maiden. Her eyes were clear light-blue, like the colour\\r\\nof the far-off sea, but it was difficult to say what was the colour of\\r\\nher hair, save that it was very light, and hung in heavy masses over\\r\\nher brow and shoulders. Once or twice her mother felt sorely frightened\\r\\nabout her; it was when spring showers were falling, and the young\\r\\ngirl had gone into the little garden in front of the cottage to let\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 199]\\r\\n\\r\\nthe rain fall upon her head and face, as she loved to do, in spite of\\r\\nall her mother could say. Then she began to dance, as she always did\\r\\nwhen the rain fell, and as she danced the sun came out while the rain\\r\\nwas yet falling. Her mother watched her from the cottage-window, but\\r\\nwhile she watched her it seemed to her as if her daughter was covered\\r\\nwith jewels of every colour, clear and bright; they hung around her in\\r\\nchains, and made her look more like a king’s daughter than a shepherd’s\\r\\ngirl. “Come in, child, come in,” called the shepherd’s wife, and when\\r\\nthe young girl came in the cottage all traces of the jewels had gone,\\r\\nand when her mother upbraided her for going out to dance in the rain,\\r\\nshe only answered, “It hurts no one, my mother, and it pleases me, why\\r\\nshould you stop me?”A little way from the cottage on the mountain-side stood an old castle,\\r\\nwhere formerly the Kings of the land used to come and stay, but which\\r\\nnow had not been used for very many years. One day, however, the\\r\\nshepherd’s wife saw great preparations were being made to beautify and\\r\\nadorn it, and she knew that the King and his son were coming to stay\\r\\nthere again. Soon after they had arrived, the shepherd’s daughter went\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 200]\\r\\n\\r\\ndown to the river, as was her wont, and sat on the bank, dipping her\\r\\nfeet in the ripples. Presently there came up a boat, and it was a grand\\r\\nyoung man dressed all in velvet and gold who leaned over the side to\\r\\nfish.“Who are you, and what are you doing here?” cried the shepherd’s\\r\\ndaughter, for she was afraid of no one.“I am the King’s son,” said he, “and I am coming here to fish. Who are\\r\\nyou, and where do you come from, for I have never seen such a beautiful\\r\\nmaiden in my life?” and he looked at her and could scarce speak, so\\r\\nbeautiful did she seem to him.“It is cruel to take the fishes out of the water,” cried the shepherd’s\\r\\ndaughter, “leave them alone, and come and dance on the bank with me,”\\r\\nand she went under the shade of a large tree, and began to dance, and\\r\\nthe King’s son watched her, and again he thought so beautiful a maid\\r\\nthere had never been.[Pg 201-2][Pg 203]Day after day he came down to the river to fish, and day after day he\\r\\nleft the line and tackle to sit and watch the shepherd’s daughter, and\\r\\neach time found her more enchanting. Once he tried to kiss her\\r\\nhand, but she sprang from him and left him sitting in his boat alone.\\r\\nAt last a day came when the Prince said to his father, “My father, you\\r\\nwant me to wed so that I may have an heir to the throne, but there is\\r\\nonly one woman that can ever be my wife, and that is the daughter of\\r\\nthe poor woman who lives in the little cottage out yonder.”At first the old King was very wroth, but he loved his son well, and\\r\\nknew that nothing would shake him from his word, so he told him that if\\r\\nhe would bring home his bride, he too would rejoice and love her as his\\r\\ndaughter even though she be a beggar-maid. Then the young Prince rode\\r\\ndown to the cottage, and went in and told the shepherd’s wife how he\\r\\nhad seen her daughter, and loved her and wished to make her his wife,\\r\\nso that she would be Queen of the country.The shepherd’s wife went nearly wild with joy. “To think that my\\r\\ndaughter should be the Queen,” she said to herself, and when her\\r\\ndaughter came into the cottage she did not know how to contain herself,\\r\\nbut folded her in her arms and kissed her, crying and declaring that\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 204]\\r\\n\\r\\nnever was woman so blessed.“Why, what has happened, my mother? and what has pleased you so?” said\\r\\nher daughter, while still the shepherd’s wife rejoiced and wept for joy.“It is the King’s son, my girl, the King’s own son, and he has just\\r\\nbeen here, and he loves you because you are so beautiful, and he will\\r\\nmarry you and make you Queen of all the land. Was there ever such luck\\r\\nfor a poor woman?”But the daughter only said, “But I don’t want to marry the King’s son,\\r\\nmother, or any one. I will never be the wife of any man; I will stay\\r\\nwith you and nurse you when you are old and sick, for I can live in no\\r\\nhouse but this cottage, and have no friend but my mother.”On hearing this the shepherd’s wife became very angry, and told her\\r\\ndaughter that she must be mad, and that she must wait for a day or two,\\r\\nand she would be only too thankful for the love of the King’s son, and\\r\\nfor the honour he was going to do her in making her his Queen. But\\r\\nstill the daughter shook her head, and said quite quietly, “I will\\r\\nnever be the wife of the King’s son.” The shepherd’s wife did not dare\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 205]\\r\\n\\r\\ntell the King’s son what her daughter had said, but told him that he\\r\\nhad better speak to her himself if he wished to make her his wife. Then\\r\\nwhen he was again sitting in the boat on the river, and the maiden on\\r\\nthe bank, the King’s son told her how much he loved her, and that he\\r\\nwould share with her all that he had in this world. But the shepherd’s\\r\\ndaughter only shook her head and said, “I will never live at the\\r\\npalace, and I will never be a Queen.”The old King had ordered great preparations to be made for the wedding,\\r\\nwhich was to take place immediately, and all sorts of fine clothes were\\r\\nordered for the shepherd’s daughter, that she might appear properly as\\r\\nthe wife of the Prince, but for the few days just before the wedding,\\r\\nthe rain fell as it had never been known to have fallen; it beat\\r\\nthrough the roofs of the cottages, and the river swelled and overflowed\\r\\nits banks; everyone was frightened, save indeed the shepherd’s\\r\\ndaughter, who went out into the wet and danced as was her wont, letting\\r\\nthe torrents fall upon her head and shoulders.But the evening before the wedding-day she knelt beside her mother’s\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 206]\\r\\n\\r\\nside. “Dear mother,” she said, “let me stop with you and nurse you when\\r\\nyou are old. Do not send me away to the palace to live with the King’s\\r\\nson.”Then the mother was very angry, and told her daughter that she was very\\r\\nungrateful, and she ought to be thankful that such luck had come in her\\r\\nway, and who was she, the daughter of a poor shepherd, that she should\\r\\nobject to marrying the King’s son?All night long the rain fell in torrents, and when next day the\\r\\nshepherd’s daughter was dressed in all her finery, it was through pools\\r\\non the ground that she had to step into the grand carriage which the\\r\\nKing had sent to fetch her, and while the marriage-service was being\\r\\nread, the priest’s voice could scarcely be heard for the pattering of\\r\\nthe drops upon the roof, and when they went into the castle to the\\r\\nbanquet, the water burst through the doors opened to receive them,\\r\\nso that the King and the wedding guests had hard ado to keep dry. It\\r\\nwas a grand feast, and the King’s son sat at one end of the table,\\r\\nand his young wife was beside him dressed in white and gold. All the\\r\\ncourtiers and all the fine guests declared that surely the world had\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 207]\\r\\n\\r\\nnever contained such a beautiful young woman as their future Queen. But\\r\\njust when the goblets were filled with wine, to drink to the health of\\r\\nthe bride and bridegroom, there came a cry, “The floods! the floods!”\\r\\nand the servants ran into the hall, crying out that the waters were\\r\\npouring in, and in one moment the rooms were filled with water, and no\\r\\none thought of anything but to save themselves. When the hurricane had\\r\\nsubsided, and the waters gone down, they looked around for the Prince’s\\r\\nwife, who was nowhere to be found. Every one said that she had been\\r\\nswept away by the torrents, and that she had been drowned in all her\\r\\nyouth and beauty; only the shepherd’s wife wept alone, and remembered\\r\\nthe words of the woman who came to her on the night of the storm: “When\\r\\nyou love aught on earth better than your daughter and her happiness,\\r\\nshe will go from you.”The King’s son mourned his wife, and for long would not be comforted;\\r\\nbut when many years had passed, he married a beautiful Princess, and\\r\\nwith her lived very happily; only when the rain fell in torrents and\\r\\nbeat against the window-panes it would seem to him as if he heard the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 208]\\r\\n\\r\\nsound of dancing feet, and a voice that called out, “Come and dance\\r\\nwith me, come and dance with me and my brothers and sisters, oh, King’s\\r\\nson, and feel our drops upon your face.”[Pg 209]\\nA Young ploughman was following his plough in a field one morning when\\r\\nsuddenly the horses stopped, and do what he would he could not make\\r\\nthem stir. Then he tried to push the plough himself, but he could\\r\\nnot move it one hair’s-breadth. He stooped down to see what could be\\r\\nstopping it, when a deep voice cried, “Stop, I am coming up.” The\\r\\nvoice was so loud that the ploughman shook with fear, but though he\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 210]\\r\\n\\r\\nlooked all around him, he could see no one from whom it could come.\\r\\nBut presently it spoke again (only this time it was a little lower),\\r\\nand called out, “Have patience, and I shall be up in a moment.” The\\r\\nploughman quaked in every limb, and stood quite still, and the voice\\r\\nbegan again (but this time it was no louder than most folks’), and it\\r\\nsaid—“If you will only not be in such a hurry, I will tell you what I\\r\\nwant. Look in front of your horse’s right foot, and pick me up.”He bent down and looked on the ground, and there in the earth, just in\\r\\nfront of his horse’s right foot, he saw what he thought was a little\\r\\nblack lizard. He touched it very cautiously, and started back with\\r\\nsurprise when the voice spoke again, and he found it came from this\\r\\ntiny creature.“Yes,” it said, “that is quite right. You can pick me up in your hand\\r\\nif you like, but I think I must grow a little bigger, as I am really\\r\\nuncomfortably small,” and while he held it on the palm of his hand,\\r\\nthe ploughman saw that it was beginning to grow larger, and it swelled\\r\\nso fast that in a few seconds it was near a foot high, and he had to\\r\\ntake both hands to hold it. Then he saw that it was not a lizard, but\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 211]\\r\\n\\r\\na little black woman with a face that looked as though it were made of\\r\\nindia-rubber, and ugly little black hands.“There, that will do,” said the strange little gnome. “That is a nice\\r\\nuseful size. Oh dear, how tiring growing is! I don’t think I’ll be any\\r\\nbigger just yet. Now be sure you don’t drop me, and handle me very\\r\\ncarefully, for I do not like to be roughly touched. I have not slept\\r\\nnearly as long as I meant to. I wanted a hundred years’ nap, and it\\r\\ncannot be more than fifty, but now that I am awake I think I will keep\\r\\nso for a bit. You seem to be rather a nice civil young man. How would\\r\\nyou like to take me for a lodger?”“A lodger!” gasped the ploughman. “Why, what should I do with you?”“I should give no trouble,” said the gnome. “But are there any women in\\r\\nyour house?”“No,” said the ploughman, “for I have no wife, and I am too poor to\\r\\nkeep a servant.”“So much the better,” said the gnome. “For though I am a woman myself,\\r\\nI detest women, and only get on with men.”[Pg 212]“You a woman!” cried the ploughman, and he laughed outright.“Of course I am a woman,” said the creature. “Come, say quickly, do you\\r\\nlike to have me for a lodger or not? Of course you will have to agree\\r\\nto my terms.”“And what are your terms?” asked the ploughman.“Only this. Whatever comes into the house, you must always give the\\r\\nbest of it to me. I will choose where I shall live for myself, when I\\r\\nsee the house, but of all the food you have, you must save the best and\\r\\ngive it to me. Not much of it, but the very best pieces. As you are\\r\\na man I cannot wear your clothes, but you can give me some of their\\r\\nmaterial, and of everything else that comes into the house of any sort,\\r\\ntobacco, or carpets, or furniture, I must have some of the best. And at\\r\\nmeals I must always be helped first. If you agree to this, I may stay\\r\\nwith you for a very long time.”“Oh, oh,” said the ploughman, “and pray what shall I get by it? It\\r\\nseems to me as if you wanted to get the best of everything and give\\r\\nnothing in return.”[Pg 213]“On the contrary,” replied the gnome, “I shall give a very great deal.\\r\\nFor as long as I remain in your house, all things will go well with\\r\\nyou. You are a poor man now, but you will soon be a rich one. If you\\r\\nsow seeds they will give twice as much crop as other people’s. All your\\r\\nanimals will do well, and in a little time, instead of being a poor\\r\\nploughman, you will be the richest farmer in the countryside.”“Well,” quoth the ploughman, “I don’t mind trying. I think it would\\r\\nrather amuse me to take you to my cottage; but if you don’t keep your\\r\\npart of the bargain, and I don’t find things are going very well with\\r\\nme, I warn you I’ll pretty soon turn you out.”“Agreed,” said the gnome; “but remember, if you fail in your compact\\r\\nwith me, I shall go by myself. Now carry me home and let me choose\\r\\nwhere I will live.”The ploughman carried the odd little figure back to his cottage, gaping\\r\\nwith astonishment; there he put it down on the kitchen-table in the\\r\\nlittle kitchen. It looked all round it, and twisted about its little\\r\\nblack head.“That will do nicely,” it said at last; “there is a little hole in\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 214]\\r\\n\\r\\nthat corner, down which I can go, and near that hole you must place all\\r\\nyour daintiest bits, and remember that I must always be helped first\\r\\nat all your meals.” And without a word it leaped from the table, and\\r\\nscuttled away down a big hole that the rats had made, and was no more\\r\\nto be seen.But when in the evening the ploughman came in to eat his meal, before\\r\\nhe began it he took the very best bit of meat and the nicest of the\\r\\nvegetable, and laid them down near the hole. Then he watched eagerly\\r\\nto see what would happen, but while he looked there they remained.\\r\\nSuddenly, however, the door shut with a bang, and he turned his head\\r\\nfor a moment to see what caused it, and when he looked back the food\\r\\nhad disappeared. Every day it was much the same. He put some of the\\r\\nbest food on the table down near the hole, but as long as he watched\\r\\nthere it remained, but when he took his eyes off for a moment it had\\r\\ndisappeared. In the same way when he had new clothes, he took a choice\\r\\nbit of material and laid it near the hole, and it vanished also. And of\\r\\nwhatever came into the house he took some of the best and did the same\\r\\nwith it.[Pg 215]Meantime things began to improve very much with him. He had only a\\r\\nlittle bit of land round his cottage, but this year the vegetables and\\r\\nfruit he had planted there grew so well that he had a large quantity to\\r\\nsend to market, and he sold them for such good prices, that soon he was\\r\\nable to get more land and buy his own animals, and in a little while\\r\\nhad a farm of his own, and had grown to be quite a rich man, while all\\r\\nhis neighbours said his luck was extraordinary. Meantime he saw or\\r\\nheard nothing more of the little black gnome, and except when he put\\r\\nthe food and other thing’s near the hole almost forgot all about her.Time passed, and the time came when the ploughman began to think he\\r\\nwould like to take a wife; he made up his mind to marry a very pretty\\r\\ngirl in the next village, who was said to be the prettiest girl in all\\r\\nthe neighbourhood. Many of the young men would have liked to marry\\r\\nher, but the ploughman was a handsome, cheery young fellow, and she\\r\\npreferred him to all of the others, and so they were married, and she\\r\\ncame home to live at the farm. The evening after their wedding they had\\r\\na fine fat fowl for supper, and the ploughman before he helped his\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 216]\\r\\n\\r\\nwife cut off the choicest slice from the breast and took it as usual to\\r\\nthe hole.“Husband,” cried the wife, “have you gone mad that you should give the\\r\\nbest of the food to the rats and the mice?”“I am not mad at all,” said the ploughman, “but my grandfather loved\\r\\nnothing in the world so well as rats and mice, and he made me promise\\r\\nbefore he died that they should always be well cared for in my house,\\r\\nand have of the best.”“Then if you are not mad,” replied the wife, “I think your grandfather\\r\\nwas! It is only the best poison that is good for rats and mice,\\r\\nand they shall have it soon, now that I am in the house.” But the\\r\\nploughman caressed his wife and begged her to let him keep his promise\\r\\nto his grandfather, and the wife held her peace, not liking to seem\\r\\nbad-tempered on her wedding-day. After a bit she got used to her\\r\\nhusband putting down little bits of food, as he said, for the rats and\\r\\nmice, and though she always declared she was going to poison them, she\\r\\ndid not try to do so, as her husband seemed grieved when she talked\\r\\nabout it.[Pg 217]Thus things went on very happily for some months, when the wife began\\r\\nto think that her clothes were getting very old, and that she must\\r\\nhave some new ones. So she took plenty of money and went into the\\r\\nneighbouring town, and came home with new dresses, and hats, and\\r\\nbonnets, and very pretty she looked in them, and her husband was very\\r\\nmuch pleased with them. But that evening after his wife was gone\\r\\nto bed, as the ploughman was finishing his pipe in the kitchen, he\\r\\nsuddenly heard a deep voice from the hole, which called out just as it\\r\\nhad done months before, “Stop, I am coming up.”For an instant the ploughman quaked with fear, then he saw something no\\r\\nbigger than a black beetle creeping through the hole, and it came in\\r\\nfront of his chair, and he heard the voice, which was not so loud this\\r\\ntime, say—“That will do, now I am going to begin to grow a little,” and it began\\r\\nto grow, and grow, and grow, till it was about eight inches high, and\\r\\nthe ploughman saw it was the little black woman. “There,” she said,\\r\\nspeaking quite quietly, “that is a nice useful size, that will do.\\r\\nNow I have something to say to you, and you will have to attend very\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 218]\\r\\n\\r\\ncarefully. I consider that you are breaking your compact. In the first\\r\\nplace, you married without asking my leave, and, as I told you, I don’t\\r\\nlike women in the house, but I will say nothing about that, as we had\\r\\nnot spoken about it before, but how can you explain about all the fine\\r\\nclothes that your wife fetched home to-day? She has taken them to her\\r\\nroom and not given one to me!”“Nay,” cried the ploughman, “they are my wife’s clothes, not mine.”“Nonsense,” said the gnome, “you gave her the money for them. Now\\r\\nunderstand that whatever she buys for herself in the future, she must\\r\\nbuy the same for me. Two of everything: dresses, hats, gloves, whatever\\r\\nshe has, I must have too, and be sure that mine are quite as good as\\r\\nhers.”“But how am I to manage that?” cried the ploughman; “how can I explain\\r\\nit to her without telling her that you are there?”“That is your business,” said the gnome. “All I say is that I must\\r\\nhave the things if I am to remain in your house. You can tell her what\\r\\nyou please. So now you know, and see that you do as I tell you,” and\\r\\nsuddenly the little figure shrunk up till it was about the size of a\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 219]\\r\\n\\r\\nblack beetle, and then disappeared down the hole without another word.The ploughman rubbed his head, and wondered what he could do. He did\\r\\nnot at all want to tell his wife about the little gnome, for he was\\r\\nsure she would not like it, but at the same time he did not want the\\r\\ngnome to leave his house and take away his luck.A few days after, his wife told him she was going to the shoemaker’s\\r\\nto buy herself some smart new shoes, and the ploughman thought of the\\r\\ngnome, and knew he must do as she had told him. So he said to his wife,\\r\\n“Wife, when you get those shoes for yourself, I wish you would get a\\r\\npair just like them for my cousin who has written to me to ask me for a\\r\\npresent. I should like to send her some nice boots and shoes as she is\\r\\nvery poor, so I shall be very much obliged if you will get two pairs of\\r\\nwhatever you may get for yourself that I may send her one.”The wife wondered very much, for she did not know the ploughman had any\\r\\ncousin; however, she went into the town, and brought home two pairs of\\r\\nsmart red shoes with bows on the top.[Pg 220]When she had gone to bed at night, the ploughman took one pair and\\r\\nlaid it by the hole in the same place where he had put the food, and\\r\\nit disappeared just as the food did without his seeing where it went.\\r\\n“Now,” thought he, “when she sees I am quite honest, perhaps the ugly\\r\\nlittle gnome will be content, and let us go on in peace.”So time went on, and the ploughman and his wife lived very happily\\r\\nand quietly, till one evening a pedlar came round with a tray holding\\r\\nall sorts of pretty things to sell. The ploughman’s wife went to the\\r\\ndoor, and looked at the things: then she bought a pretty comb for her\\r\\nhair, but she would not show it to her husband, as she meant to wear it\\r\\nbefore him as a surprise next day.But that evening after his wife had gone to bed, as the ploughman\\r\\nsat finishing his pipe by the fire, he heard the voice from the hole\\r\\ncalling as loudly as ever, “Stop! I am coming up.” Again the ploughman\\r\\nquaked with fear, and then he saw coming through the hole something no\\r\\nbigger than a black beetle, and again the voice said in a lower tone,\\r\\n“Now I will begin to grow a little,” and presently the tiny black\\r\\nthing had swelled into the ugly little black woman with the face like\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 221]\\r\\n\\r\\nindia-rubber.“Listen to me,” she said, “and know that I am beginning to feel very\\r\\nangry. You are beginning to cheat me. To-day your wife bought herself\\r\\na brand-new comb from a pedlar at the door, and never got one for me.\\r\\nTo-morrow evening I must have that comb. I don’t care how you get it,\\r\\nbut have it I must.”The ploughman scratched his head and was sore perplexed. “What on earth\\r\\nam I to do?” he cried, “for my wife will think me very cruel if I take\\r\\naway all the pretty little things she buys for herself.”“I can’t help that,” answered the gnome. “I have got to have that comb\\r\\nby this time to-morrow night, and I warn you if you begin to deceive\\r\\nme, just as if I were an ordinary human being, I shall pretty soon take\\r\\nmyself off,” and with that the gnome disappeared through the hole in an\\r\\ninstant.Next morning at breakfast the wife came down with the new comb in her\\r\\nhair, and said to her husband, “See, husband, I bought this of the\\r\\npedlar yesterday, and he tells me they are quite the newest fashion,\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 222]\\r\\n\\r\\nand all the great ladies in town are wearing them.”“Well,” quoth the ploughman, “such a fashion may be all very well for\\r\\nthe great ladies who have scarce any hair of their own, but, for my own\\r\\npart, I had rather see your beautiful hair just as it is without any\\r\\nadornment.”At this the wife pouted, and was very cross. “’Tis too bad of you\\r\\nto say that. I thought you would like your wife to wear all the new\\r\\nfashions, and be smart like other folks.”“Nay,” cried the ploughman, “my wife is much prettier than other folks,\\r\\nand she looks prettiest of all when she has little to adorn her. If any\\r\\nof these great ladies had hair like yours you may be sure they would\\r\\npretty soon throw away any combs or caps or pins, so that nothing but\\r\\ntheir hair should be seen.”When her husband was gone, the wife went to her glass and looked at\\r\\nherself, and took out the comb and then put it in, and tried it every\\r\\nway. “’Tis true, for sure,” said she, “my hair is very beautiful, and\\r\\nmaybe it looks best done up as I used to wear it, still it seems a pity\\r\\nnot to use the comb when I have bought it.” So when her husband came\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 223]\\r\\n\\r\\nback, she said to him, “I believe you are right, husband, and it suits\\r\\nme better not to have anything in my hair, but maybe if you are wanting\\r\\nto send a present to that cousin of yours, you would like to send her\\r\\nthat comb. It would save buying anything fresh.”On this the ploughman laughed to himself, but he thanked his wife very\\r\\nmuch and put the comb in his pocket. In the evening after the wife had\\r\\ngone to bed, the ploughman took it, and put it down by the hole, and\\r\\nthen went on smoking his pipe without waiting to see if it disappeared.\\r\\nBut in a few minutes he heard the voice crying, “Stop! I am coming up,”\\r\\nand saw again the gnome come through the hole and then begin to grow as\\r\\nbefore. “Now this is too bad,” cried the ploughman. “What can you want\\r\\nnow? Here I have just given you the comb you wanted, and nothing else\\r\\nnew has come into the house.” “On the contrary,” answered the gnome, “I\\r\\nconsider that you have brought a great many new things into the house\\r\\nsince I came to live here, and I mean now to have my choice of some of\\r\\nthem, since I do not find that you are honest enough to offer them to\\r\\nme. To begin with, I want your wife’s hair. I have been trying mine\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 224]\\r\\n\\r\\nwith that comb, and I find I can’t make it do at all, and so I mean to\\r\\nhave your wife’s.”“My wife’s!” gasped the ploughman. “You must be mad!”“Mad or not mad,” replied the gnome, “I mean to have it, and, moreover,\\r\\nit is my due. You married without consulting me, and if I kept you to\\r\\nyour bargain, I should have a great deal that I have not got. Certainly\\r\\nyour wife has the best head of hair in the house, so you must cut it\\r\\noff near her head and bring it all to me.”“But whatever shall I say to my wife?” cried the ploughman in distress.“That is your look-out, not mine,” said the gnome. “Anyhow you have got\\r\\nto give it to me. But as the thought of it seems to annoy you I will\\r\\ngive you a week to get it in.”The ploughman sat and thought and thought, and very sad did he feel\\r\\nat thinking of all his wife’s beautiful hair being given away to the\\r\\nlittle gnome.Next day he took his horse and cart, and told his wife he had to go for\\r\\na long drive on business to a big town, a long way off. It was quite\\r\\nthe biggest town in that neighbourhood, and many very fine people\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 225]\\r\\n\\r\\nlived there. At first the wife wanted to go too, but her husband said\\r\\nit was too far and she would be too tired, as he could not be back till\\r\\nvery late at night.Next morning, when they sat at breakfast, he told his wife all he had\\r\\nheard and seen in the big town, and then he added, “And all the very\\r\\nfine ladies there have now the funniest fashion.”“And what is that?” asked his wife; “pray tell me, for I love to hear\\r\\nthe new fashions.”“Why,” said the ploughman, “’tis with their hair. Instead of wearing it\\r\\nlong, they have it cut quite close all round their heads, because they\\r\\nsay it looks smarter now.”“Well, I do call that a silly fashion,” said the wife; “they can’t have\\r\\nhad much hair to consent to have had it cut off.”“No, indeed,” said her husband, “and yet with some of them, they look\\r\\nvery smart and pretty with their little curly heads.”“Much like boys, I should think,” said the wife scornfully.“No, not quite that, either,” said the ploughman, “more like the\\r\\npictures of angels in the old churches, and they say it is the great\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 226]\\r\\n\\r\\nthing for it to curl up all round the head, and when it does that of\\r\\nitself, they are very proud of it.”“Well, then, some of them might be very proud of mine,” said the wife,\\r\\n“for it’s as curly as may be, and if I were to cut it short would be\\r\\nall in tiny curls.”When her husband had gone to his work, the ploughman’s wife could do\\r\\nnothing but think of the strange new fashion of which her husband had\\r\\ntold her. “I wonder how it would suit me,” she thought, and when he\\r\\ncame in to dinner she said to him—“Husband, is it really true that all those fine ladies looked very\\r\\npretty and smart with their hair short?”“Ay, that they did,” he said; “I was quite surprised to see them, and\\r\\nI heard they said ’twas a wonderful saving of trouble, and that their\\r\\nhair could never grow untidy.”“That is true,” said the wife, “yet I should be sorry to cut mine off.”[Pg 227-8]\\n“No need that you should,” said the ploughman, “and there are not many\\r\\nfolks up here to see if we are in the fashion or not. All the same,\\r\\nyou are sure to look prettier than the town ladies any way, whichever\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 229]\\r\\n\\r\\nway your hair is done, for your face is prettier.”But when her husband had gone away again the wife went to her glass\\r\\nwith the scissors in her hand. “As my husband says,” she quoth, “it\\r\\nwould be a wonderful saving of trouble, and then it would be very nice\\r\\nto let all the women round see that I could be in the fashion before\\r\\nthey. I wonder how it would look?” and she snipped off a big bit. “Here\\r\\ngoes,” she cried; “after all ’tis best to follow the fashions, whatever\\r\\nthey are,” and she went on cutting till, when her husband came in, he\\r\\nfound her with her hair all cut off beside her.“There, husband,” cried she, “do I look like the smart ladies in town?”“Ay, that you do,” he answered, “only ten times prettier; but as for\\r\\nall that beautiful hair, you must just give it to me, for it is so\\r\\nbeautiful I would not let it be lost for anything,” and he took up all\\r\\nthe heap of fine gold hair and tied it together with a bright ribbon.The wife looked at herself in the glass, and thought she really looked\\r\\nvery nice with little curls all round her head, and though the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 230]\\r\\n\\r\\nploughman grieved over it in his heart, yet he was glad he had got her\\r\\nhair, and thought, “Now at last that miserable little gnome will be\\r\\ncontent, and leave me alone.” So that evening, when his wife was gone\\r\\nto bed, he took the bunch of hair and laid it near the hole, and it\\r\\ndisappeared, and he knew the gnome had it.So for a time all went on quietly with the ploughman, and he hoped he\\r\\nshould not hear more of the gnome, but one evening, after his wife had\\r\\ngone to bed and he was in the kitchen smoking his pipe alone, he heard\\r\\nthe hated voice shouting, “Stop! I am coming up,” and then he saw the\\r\\nlittle black thing like a black beetle coming through the hole, and all\\r\\nhappened just as before.“Well, what do you want now?” cried the ploughman when he saw the ugly\\r\\nlittle woman in front of him. “I have given you my wife’s hair, and\\r\\nsurely you ought to be content.”“Not at all,” said the gnome, “for I have tried on her hair, and I find\\r\\nit does not suit my complexion. I have never seen her myself, and I\\r\\ndon’t think you any judge, but I heard you telling her that her face\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 231]\\r\\n\\r\\nwas prettier than any of the town ladies. In that case you have no\\r\\nright to keep it for yourself. I must have your wife’s face.”“My wife’s face!” screamed the ploughman, “I think you must be mad. How\\r\\ncan I give you my wife’s face? And what would you do with it?”“Wear it,” answered the gnome; “and all you have to do is to fetch your\\r\\nwife in here this day week, and tell her what I wish; and I will come\\r\\nup and scrape off as much of her face as I want.”“Why, it would kill her,” cried the ploughman.“Not at all,” said the gnome, “neither would it hurt her, for she would\\r\\nscarcely feel my little knife; the only thing is, that when I have\\r\\ndone, her skin will be rather black and shrivelled like my own, but as\\r\\nmine has been good enough for me all these years, it will surely be\\r\\ngood enough for a common human woman. Anyhow, now you know. I must have\\r\\nyour wife’s complexion to wear with her hair, or else I go at once. And\\r\\nas it will be you who have broken the compact, I shall take all your\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 232]\\r\\n\\r\\nwealth with me.” And repeating in a deep voice, “Remember, this day\\r\\nweek at twelve o’clock,” the gnome grew small, and disappeared through\\r\\nthe hole.Next day the ploughman was very miserable, and whenever he looked at\\r\\nhis wife felt inclined to burst into tears. The wife, not knowing what\\r\\nwas amiss, tried to cheer him, and asked if he were ill. But he shook\\r\\nhis head, and told her “no,” and had not the courage to tell her the\\r\\ntruth. Thus things went on, the ploughman growing sadder and sadder\\r\\nevery day, till the evening before that on which the gnome had told him\\r\\nhe must bring his wife to meet her. The ploughman was scarce able to\\r\\ncheck his sobs before his wife, and at last she came into the kitchen,\\r\\nand there found him crying outright.When she saw this, she kneeled down by him, and said, “Husband, you\\r\\nsurely do not think me a good wife, for a good wife shares all her\\r\\nhusband’s troubles. Tell me what troubles you. Two heads are better\\r\\nthan one, and perhaps I can help you.”Then the ploughman told her all about the hated gnome, and how he had\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 233]\\r\\n\\r\\nfound it in a field, and how he had promised to give it some of the\\r\\nbest of everything, and now how it wanted her face.At first the wife would scarcely believe it, and then she cried, “But\\r\\nif ’tis such a little creature why not pick it up and strangle it, or\\r\\nlet me put my foot on it, while it is no bigger than a black beetle.”“Nay, do not think of such a thing,” said her husband, “for it is ill\\r\\nto play tricks with fairy folk, and most likely she would kill us\\r\\noutright.”“But part with my face I never will,” cried the wife.“Then we will let her go and take with her the house and all our\\r\\nwealth, and be contented to live in my old cottage again, and be quite\\r\\npoor folk,” said her husband.On hearing this the wife burst into tears, and wept more bitterly than\\r\\nher husband, for she would not stop at all. It was in vain for him to\\r\\ntry to cheer her and tell her that poor folk could be quite as happy\\r\\nas rich ones. She declared she could never be happy poor. Then when\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 234]\\r\\n\\r\\nhe said if she would let her face go, he would love her just as much\\r\\nor more without it, she cried that she could never be happy with a\\r\\ndreadful shrivelled black skin like a monkey’s. All that night she\\r\\ncried, and when morning came her skin was all red, and her eyes could\\r\\nscarce be seen, so swelled were their lids, but still she cried on all\\r\\nday, and her husband said nothing to comfort her, because he did not\\r\\nknow what to say. By the time it grew dark, her face was so swelled and\\r\\nsore that she could not bear to touch it, and she had cried herself\\r\\nalmost blind, but still the tears were rolling down. When the time came\\r\\nfor the clock to strike twelve, her husband took her hand and led her\\r\\nto the kitchen, and there she sat with her face in her hands sobbing.\\r\\nJust as the clock struck, they heard the voice like thunder shouting,\\r\\n“Stop! I am coming up,” and the wife peeped between her fingers and\\r\\nsaw the little thing no bigger than a black beetle come through the\\r\\nhole and then grow, and grow, and grow, till it was like an ugly little\\r\\nblack woman near a foot high. And when she saw how hideous it was she\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 235]\\r\\n\\r\\nthought, “Never, never will I consent to have a skin like that—not for\\r\\nmillions of pounds.”The gnome did not speak to her, but said to the ploughman, “So you have\\r\\nbrought your wife. That is a good thing, if you wish me to remain with\\r\\nyou. So now tell her to take down her hands and let me see this face\\r\\nyou make such a fuss about. I have my knife all ready.”And the ploughman saw that she had in her hand a tiny knife, which did\\r\\nnot look as if it could hurt any one.“Wife, wife,” groaned the ploughman, “what shall we do?”Then the wife looked up out of her swollen eyes, and was just going to\\r\\nspeak, when the gnome gave a shriek. “What?” she cried, “that face! Do\\r\\nyou mean to say that is what you think so pretty, and that I am going\\r\\nto change my beautiful, dry, black skin for that swollen red mass? No,\\r\\nindeed. You must be mad. It is a good thing that I saw it in time. I\\r\\nshall leave the house at once.”“Nay,” cried the ploughman, “but it is you who are breaking your\\r\\ncompact this time.”[Pg 236]But the gnome made no reply, but scuttled down through the hole as fast\\r\\nas it could, and the ploughman and his wife burst out laughing for joy.\\r\\nAnd that was the last they ever saw of it, and it must have gone right\\r\\naway, but they knew it had left some of its luck behind it, as they\\r\\nboth lived happily for the rest of their days.THE END\\nRichard Clay & Sons, Limited, London & Bungay.\\nSYLVIA IN\\r\\nFLOWERLAND.

              " '43.',\n",
              " '][Pg ii][Pg iii][Pg 1-2][Pg 3]\\nThere was once a\\r\\nwindmill which stood on the downs by the sea, far from any town or\\r\\nvillage, and in which the miller lived alone with his little daughter.',\n",
              " 'His wife had died when the little girl, whose name was Lucilla, was a\\r\\nbaby, and so the miller lived by himself with his child, of whom he was\\r\\nvery proud.',\n",
              " 'As her father was busy with his work, and as little Lucilla\\r\\nhad no other children to play with, she was alone nearly all day,\\r\\nand had to amuse herself as best she could, and one of her greatest\\r\\npleasures was to sit and watch the great sails of the windmill figures like them, and they\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 4]\\r\\n\\r\\nheld each other by the hand, and were dancing and springing from the\\r\\nground as lightly as if they had been made of feather-down.“Come, sisters, come,” cried the one nearest Lucilla.',\n",
              " '“See, here is a\\r\\nlittle human child out here alone at twelve o’clock at night.',\n",
              " 'Come and\\r\\nlet us play with her.”“Who are you?” asked Lucilla; “my name is Lucilla, and I live in the\\r\\nmill with my father.”“We are windfairies,” said the first grey figure.“Windfairies!” said Lucilla, “what are they?”“We blow the winds and sweep the earth.',\n",
              " 'When there are many of us\\r\\ntogether we make a great hurricane, and human beings are frightened.',\n",
              " 'We\\r\\nit is who turn your mill wheel for you, and make all the little waves\\r\\non the sea.',\n",
              " 'See, if you will come with us we will take you for a ride\\r\\non one of the sails of your mill.',\n",
              " 'That is, if you will be brave, and\\r\\nnot cry.”“I will not cry one bit,” said Lucilla, and she sprang up, and held out\\r\\nher arms.At once she was lifted up, and felt herself going higher and higher,\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 5]\\r\\n\\r\\ntill she rested on one of the great windmill sails, and, with the\\r\\nlittle grey elves beside her, was sweeping through the air, clinging to\\r\\nthe sail.“She is quite good,” whispered one, as she held Lucilla in her tiny\\r\\nwhite arms.',\n",
              " '“I really think we might teach her to dance, for she has\\r\\nnot cried at all.”“No, she would surely tell some one if we did,” said another.',\n",
              " '“Little\\r\\nhuman child, would you like us to teach you how to dance as we dance?”“Yes, yes,” cried Lucilla; and now they were sweeping down near the\\r\\nground, and the fairies slid off the sail with Lucilla in their arms,\\r\\nand let her slide gently to earth.',\n",
              " '“Teach me to dance, I beg.',\n",
              " 'I will\\r\\nnever tell anybody.”“Ah, but that is what all mortals say,” whispered one who had not\\r\\nspoken yet, “no mortal can keep a secret.',\n",
              " 'Never yet was one known who\\r\\ncould be silent.”“Try me,” cried Lucilla again, “I will never tell.',\n",
              " 'Indeed I will not,”\\r\\nand she looked entreatingly from one to another of the elves.“But if you did,” said they, “if you broke your promise to us when\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 6]\\r\\n\\r\\nonce you had made it, we should punish you severely.”“But I promise faithfully,” repeated Lucilla, “I will never tell any\\r\\none.”“Well then, you may try,” they said.',\n",
              " '“Only remember, if you break\\r\\nyour word to us, and tell any mortal who it was that taught you how\\r\\nto dance, you will never dance again, for your feet will become heavy\\r\\nas lead, and not only that, but some great misfortune will overtake\\r\\nwhatever you love best in this world.',\n",
              " 'But if you keep faith with us,\\r\\nthen the windfairies will never forget you, but will come to your help\\r\\nin your direst hour of need.”“Teach me, teach me,” cried Lucilla; “indeed I will never, never tell,\\r\\nand I long to dance as you do.”“Come then,” they said, and some came behind her, and some went in\\r\\nfront of her, and some took her arms and some her feet, and all at\\r\\nonce Lucilla felt as if she were made of feather-down.',\n",
              " 'She swayed up\\r\\nand down as lightly as they, and it seemed to her quite easy.',\n",
              " 'Never\\r\\nhad she been so happy, and she would gladly have danced for hours, but\\r\\nsuddenly, just as the sun was beginning to show a red light in the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 7]\\r\\n\\r\\nsky, she heard her father’s horse galloping over the downs, and in an\\r\\ninstant the windfairies had vanished.When the miller came up to her, he was angry with her for being out on\\r\\nthe grass instead of warm in bed, but Lucilla dared not tell him what\\r\\nhad kept her, or say that she had been playing with windfairies.Years passed, and Lucilla never saw the windfairies again, though she\\r\\nwatched for them every night.',\n",
              " 'She grew up to be a beautiful young\\r\\nwoman, and her father was very proud of her.',\n",
              " 'She was as tall and as\\r\\nlithe as a willow wand, and when she ran or danced it seemed as if she\\r\\nwere as light as a feather blown in the wind.',\n",
              " 'There were few people\\r\\nto see her, or tell her she was beautiful, for save the fisher folk\\r\\nwho lived in little cottages on the beach, scarce anybody came to the\\r\\ndowns.',\n",
              " 'But all who saw her admired her beauty, and most of all her\\r\\nwonderful dancing.',\n",
              " 'Sometimes she would go out on the downs, and dance\\r\\nand run there by herself, and her father would look at her and say:\\r\\n“Heaven help the maid!',\n",
              " 'I don’t know whom she has learned it from, but\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 8]\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never seen a dancer who can come nigh her.” Then sometimes she\\r\\nwould go down to the sea-shore, and this she loved to do best of all,\\r\\nand there she would dance with the waves, and move with them as they\\r\\nslid up to her feet and drew back, and to those who watched, it seemed\\r\\nas if she and they were one together.The time came when her father wished her to be married, and among the\\r\\nyoung fishermen and the country folk who came to the mill from the\\r\\nfarms across the country, she had suitors enough, but always she said\\r\\nwhen a young man came to woo her, “First let me see how you can dance,\\r\\nfor as dancing is the thing I love best in the world, it would be a\\r\\npity that I and my husband should not be able to dance together,” and\\r\\nas none of them could dance as she did, she sent them all away, saying\\r\\nshe would wait for a husband till she could find a man who could dance\\r\\nto her liking.But one day there was a great storm, and a big ship was blown on to\\r\\nthe shore close to the mill, and among the sailors was a young fellow\\r\\nwith black curly hair and bright eyes and white teeth, and when he saw\\r\\nLucilla, he said to himself, “I will wed that girl and take her home\\r\\nfor my wife.” So one day as they sat on the downs together he begged\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 9]\\r\\n\\r\\nher to marry him, and go back with him to his own land; he said he\\r\\nwould give up going to sea, and would live with her in a little cottage\\r\\nand make their bread by fishing.',\n",
              " 'Then Lucilla said, as she had said\\r\\nto all her other suitors, “First let me see how you can dance, for I\\r\\nwill never marry any man who cannot dance with me.” The sailor swore he\\r\\ncould dance as well as any man in the world, for all sailors can dance,\\r\\nhe said, and they began to dance together on the downs.',\n",
              " 'The sailor\\r\\ndanced well and merrily, but Lucilla danced faster, and seemed as if\\r\\nshe were made of feather-down; and then the sailor, seeing that his\\r\\ndancing was as nothing to hers, caught her by the waist, and held her\\r\\nstill, crying, “My sweetheart, I cannot dance as you can, but my arms\\r\\nare strong enough to hold you still and keep you from dancing with any\\r\\nman but me.”So Lucilla married the sailor, and went with him to live in his little\\r\\ncottage by the sea, many miles away from the mill, and as her father\\r\\nwas growing old and no longer cared to work, he went with her too.',\n",
              " '[Pg 10]For some time the sailor and Lucilla lived together very happily, and\\r\\nthey had two little children, and her husband fished and sold his fish,\\r\\nand often still, Lucilla would go down to the waves and dance with them\\r\\nas she had done in her old home.',\n",
              " 'She tried to teach her little children\\r\\nto dance as she did, but they could not learn because the windfairies\\r\\nhad never touched them.',\n",
              " 'But one winter her husband’s boat was dashed to\\r\\npieces, and the sea froze so that all the fish died, and they became so\\r\\npoor that they could barely get enough to eat.',\n",
              " 'Then it chanced that a\\r\\nbig ship came to the village where they lived, and the captain wanted\\r\\nmen for a long journey, and her husband told Lucilla that he had best\\r\\ngo with him, and then he would have enough money to buy another boat,\\r\\nand then next year they must hope for better luck.',\n",
              " 'So Lucilla was left\\r\\nalone in the cottage with her father and her two little children, and\\r\\nshe felt very lonely and sad without her husband, and often she thought\\r\\nof the mill and the windfairies, and when the wind blew, she would go\\r\\ndown to the water’s edge and hold out her arms and pray them to take\\r\\ncare of her husband’s ship, and bring it safe home again.',\n",
              " '[Pg 11]“Oh, kind windfairies,” she cried, “see, I have kept faith with you, so\\r\\ndo you now keep faith with me, and do me no hurt.” And often she would\\r\\ndance by the edge of the waves, as she used to do in her old home, and\\r\\nthink that the windfairies were dancing with her, and holding up her\\r\\nsteps.Now it chanced that one day, as Lucilla was dancing on the shore, there\\r\\nrode by two horsemen, and they stopped and watched her as she danced,\\r\\nwith the waves coming close to her feet.',\n",
              " 'Then they got down from their\\r\\nhorses, and asked who she was, and where she had learned such dancing.',\n",
              " 'She told them she was only the wife of a poor fisherman, but she had\\r\\ndanced for long years, since she was a little child, when she had lived\\r\\nin a windmill, on the downs far away.',\n",
              " 'They rode away, but next day they\\r\\ncame again, and brought others with them, and begged Lucilla that she\\r\\nwould go down to the water’s edge and dance with the waves as she had\\r\\ndone yesterday.',\n",
              " 'So she ran down the beach, and danced in time to the\\r\\nsea as it moved, and the strangers all applauded, and said to each\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 12]\\r\\n\\r\\nother, “It is wonderful, it is marvellous.”They then told her that they came from a country where the King loved\\r\\nnothing so much as beautiful dancing, and that he would give great sums\\r\\nof money to any one who danced well, and if she would go back with them\\r\\nto his court, and dance before the King, she should have a sack of gold\\r\\nto take home with her, and this would make her a rich woman, and her\\r\\nhusband would never have need to work any more.At first she refused, and said her husband was away, and would not\\r\\nknow where she was gone, and she did not like to leave her two little\\r\\nchildren; but still the courtiers persuaded her, and said it would not\\r\\nbe for long, and her father persuaded her too, since he said it would\\r\\nmake them all rich if she brought home a sack of gold.',\n",
              " 'So at last\\r\\nLucilla agreed that she would go back with them to the King’s court\\r\\nand dance there, but she made them promise that before the spring came\\r\\nthey would send her back to her own little cottage.',\n",
              " 'On hearing this,\\r\\nthe strangers were much delighted, and bid Lucilla make ready to start\\r\\nat once, and that night she said good-bye to her little ones, and\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nleft them, to go with the travellers.',\n",
              " 'Her eyes were red with crying at\\r\\nleaving her home, and before she started, she went out alone on to the\\r\\ncliffs, and stretched out her arms, and called to the windfairies to go\\r\\nwith her and help her, for she feared what she was going to do, and she\\r\\nbegged them to be true to her, as she had been true to them.They sailed for many days, till at last they came to a country of which\\r\\nLucilla had never even heard, and to a big town, which seemed to her\\r\\nas if it must hold all the people in the world, so crowded was it, and\\r\\nabove the town on the hill, they pointed out to her a royal palace, and\\r\\ntold her it was where the King dwelt, and there she would have to dance\\r\\nere the week was out.“And it is most lucky we saw you just now,” said they, “for the King is\\r\\njust going to be married, and in a few days the Princess will arrive,\\r\\nand there will be festivities and rejoicing for days, and at some of\\r\\nthese you will appear before their Majesties, and be sure you dance\\r\\nyour very best.”Then Lucilla went with them into a great hall close to the palace,\\r\\nwhere musicians were playing on every kind of instrument, and here the\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 14]\\r\\n\\r\\ncourtiers bid her dance on a platform at one end of the hall, in time\\r\\nto the music; and when they had seen it, the musicians one and all lay\\r\\ndown their instruments, and rose together, clapping and applauding, and\\r\\nall declared that it was the greatest of luck that the travellers had\\r\\nmet with Lucilla, and that it would delight the King more than anything\\r\\nthey had prepared for him.By and by the Princess who was to marry the King arrived, and the\\r\\nwedding was celebrated with much magnificence, and after the wedding\\r\\nthere was a feast, and in the evening there was to be singing and\\r\\ndancing, and all sorts of play for the royal couple and the court to\\r\\nsee, and then Lucilla was to dance.',\n",
              " 'The courtier who brought her wished\\r\\nher to be dressed in the most gorgeous dress, with gold and jewels, but\\r\\nshe pleaded that she might wear a light grey gown like the windfairies,\\r\\nbecause she remembered how they looked when they danced on the downs.When the evening came when she was to dance before the King, she threw\\r\\nwide her window and held out her arms, and cried out, “Now help me,\\r\\ndear windfairies, as you have done before; keep faith with me, as I\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 15]\\r\\n\\r\\nhave kept faith with you.” But in truth she could scarce keep from\\r\\ncrying with thoughts of her husband at sea, and her little ones at the\\r\\ncottage at home.The hall was brilliantly lighted, and in the middle on the throne sat\\r\\nthe King and the young Queen.',\n",
              " 'The musicians began to play, and then\\r\\nLucilla stepped forth on the platform and began to dance.',\n",
              " 'She felt as\\r\\nlight as the sea foam, and when she swayed and curved to the sound of\\r\\nthe music, it seemed to her as if she heard only the swish of the waves\\r\\nas they beat upon the shore, and the murmur of the wind as it played\\r\\nwith the water, and she thought of her husband out at sea, with the\\r\\nwind blowing his ship along, and of her little babies living in the\\r\\ncottage on the beach.When she stopped, there was such a noise of applauding and cheering in\\r\\nthe hall, as had never been heard there before, and the King sent for\\r\\nher, and asked her where she came from, and who had taught her such\\r\\nwonderful steps, but she only answered that she was the daughter of a\\r\\npoor miller, who lived in a windmill, and she thought she must have\\r\\nlearnt to dance from watching the windmill’s sails go round.',\n",
              " 'Every\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 16]\\r\\n\\r\\nnight the King would have her dance again and again, as he never tired\\r\\nof watching her, and every night Lucilla said to herself, “Now another\\r\\nnight is gone, and I am one day nearer to their taking me back to my\\r\\nown home and my children, with a bag of gold to give to my husband when\\r\\nhe comes back from sea.”The new Queen was a handsome woman, but she was very jealous, and it\\r\\nmade her angry that the King should admire the new dancer’s dancing so\\r\\nmuch, and she thought she would like to be able to dance like her.',\n",
              " 'So\\r\\none evening when no one was watching her, she put on a big cloak that\\r\\ncovered her all over, and asked her way to where the dancer lived.',\n",
              " 'Lucilla sat alone in the little house that they had given her to live\\r\\nin, and the Queen came in behind her, and took off her cloak, and\\r\\nbade her be silent and not say her name, for fear some one should be\\r\\nlistening and know that she was there.“Now,” she said, “I have come to you that you may tell me, though no\\r\\none else knows it, who taught you to dance, that I may go and learn\\r\\nfrom them also to dance like you; for in the home that I come from, I\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 17]\\r\\n\\r\\nwas said to be the most graceful woman in the land and the best dancer,\\r\\nso that there is no dancing that I cannot learn.”Lucilla trembled, but she answered:“Your Majesty, I lived in a little windmill by the sea when I was a\\r\\nchild, far from teachers or dancers, but I watched the windmill sails\\r\\ngo round, morn, noon, and night; and perhaps it is that that taught me\\r\\nto dance as I do now.',\n",
              " 'And if your Majesty wishes to learn to do what\\r\\nI do, I will gladly teach you all I know, and doubtless you will soon\\r\\nlearn to dance far better than I.”Upon this the Queen was delighted, and flung aside her cloak, and stood\\r\\nopposite to Lucilla, and begged her to begin to teach her at once, that\\r\\nshe might learn as soon as possible.',\n",
              " 'All that evening they danced, but\\r\\nwhen the Queen thought she looked just as Lucilla did, she appeared to\\r\\nbe quite awkward and heavy beside her, and was dancing just as other\\r\\nmortals might.',\n",
              " 'When she went away she was very much pleased, and said\\r\\nthat she would come twice more to learn from her, and then she was\\r\\nsure that she would be perfect.',\n",
              " 'In her heart Lucilla was very much\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 18]\\r\\n\\r\\nfrightened, because she knew that the Queen did not dance as she did,\\r\\nand never could.',\n",
              " 'However, the next night she came again, and the next\\r\\nagain, and then there was to be a grand court ball; and at this the\\r\\nQueen thought she would first show her husband how she could dance.',\n",
              " 'The King himself was fond of dancing, and danced well, although not\\r\\nhalf so well as Lucilla’s husband the sailor; and the Queen thought\\r\\nhow delighted he would be when he saw what a graceful wife he had got.',\n",
              " 'As the ball began, all the fine people were saying to each other, it\\r\\nreally seemed silly to dance after they had seen the wonderful new\\r\\ndancer, but the Queen smiled and thought to herself, “Now they will see\\r\\nthat I can do quite as well as she.” When her turn came she tripped\\r\\nlightly forward and danced as best she could, and thought it was just\\r\\nlike Lucilla, and the courtiers said among each other, “Our new Queen\\r\\ndances well,” but no one thought of saying that it was like Lucilla’s\\r\\ndancing, and the King said nothing at all on the matter; therefore the\\r\\nQueen felt herself growing hot and angry, and she turned red and white\\r\\nby turns.',\n",
              " '[Pg 19]“That lying wench has been tricking me,” she said to herself, “and\\r\\nshe has not taught me right at all; but I will punish her for her\\r\\ndeception, and soon she shall know what it is to deceive a Queen.”So the next day she went to her husband and said, “Husband, I have\\r\\nthought much of the new wonderful dancer whom we all admire so much,\\r\\nand truly I have never seen any one on earth who could dance as she\\r\\ncan; but now I think we should do well before she goes back to her own\\r\\nhome to know who has taught her her marvellous art, so that we may have\\r\\nour court dancers taught, that they may be there to please us when she\\r\\nis gone, for really there is nothing on earth that cannot be learnt if\\r\\nit is taught in the right way.”The King agreed, and they sent for Lucilla, and the King asked her to\\r\\ntell him where she had learnt her dancing, that they might summon the\\r\\nsame teachers to teach their court dancers.',\n",
              " 'But Lucilla answered as\\r\\nbefore—she did not know—she thought she must have learnt dancing from\\r\\nwatching the windmill sails going round.',\n",
              " 'At this the King became angry,\\r\\nand said, “That is nonsense, no one could learn dancing from looking\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 20]\\r\\n\\r\\nat windmill sails, neither was it possible that she, a poor miller’s\\r\\ndaughter, could have learnt such dancing by nature;” then he threatened\\r\\nher, that if she would not tell him the truth he should be obliged to\\r\\npunish her, and he said she should have a day to think of it in, but at\\r\\nthe end of the next day, he should expect her to tell him everything he\\r\\nwanted to know quite plainly.When she was gone away the King said to the Queen, “Wife, if this\\r\\ndancer persists in her silence, and will not tell us how she has\\r\\nlearnt, there is another thing which we must do.',\n",
              " 'We must keep her here\\r\\nto dance for us as much as we choose, and not let her return at all to\\r\\nthe home from which she came.”The Queen was silent for a little, but she felt very jealous at the\\r\\nthought of the dancer remaining at the court, so she nodded her head\\r\\nand said, “Yes, but I think she ought to tell us more about it; for\\r\\nmyself, I begin to think that it is witchcraft, and perhaps she has\\r\\nbeen taught by the Evil One, and then we shouldn’t like her to remain\\r\\nhere and dance to us however beautiful it be, for who knows what ill\\r\\nluck it might not bring upon us?” Upon this the King looked grave, and\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 21]\\r\\n\\r\\nsaid he did not believe much in ill luck or good luck, but he should be\\r\\nloth to lose the dancer, so they had better settle to keep her if she\\r\\ndeclined to tell them how the other dancers were to be taught.Meantime Lucilla went back to her little house, and wept bitterly.',\n",
              " '“Would that I had never left my babes and my home,” she cried, “for I\\r\\ncannot break my word to the windfairies, and if I did they might do\\r\\nsome terrible harm to my little ones or to my husband at sea; yet if I\\r\\nrefuse to tell them they will most likely put me into prison, and there\\r\\nI shall remain for my life, and my husband and children will never\\r\\nknow what has become of me.” And she knelt down before the windows and\\r\\nlifted her arms and cried out, “Oh, dear windfairies, I have not broken\\r\\nfaith with you, so don’t break faith with me, and come to my help and\\r\\nsave me in my trouble.”Next evening Lucilla went again before the King, and he said to her,\\r\\n“Well, now will you tell us what we asked you last night, so that we\\r\\nmay send for your teachers, and have others taught to dance as you do?”[Pg 22]“My gracious liege,” answered Lucilla, “I can tell you nothing that I\\r\\nhave not told you before.',\n",
              " 'Since I was a child I have danced as I dance\\r\\nnow, and I watched the sails of my father’s windmill, and I danced in\\r\\ntime to the waves, and perhaps that is what taught me to keep time and\\r\\nstep so well.',\n",
              " 'I was dancing by the sea-shore when the travellers who\\r\\nbrought me here found me, and they promised me a bag of gold to take\\r\\nhome to my husband if I would come and dance at your Majesty’s court;\\r\\nand now you have seen me dance, and I have done all I can do, so I\\r\\nentreat you to give me the bag of gold, and let me go home again.”The King was silent, but the Queen was still more angry, and in her\\r\\nheart was determined that Lucilla should never return to her home until\\r\\nshe had found out about her dancing.',\n",
              " 'So when they were alone she said\\r\\nto her husband, “It is now quite clear, it is by witchcraft that this\\r\\nwoman has learned, and we should do very wrong if we let her go till\\r\\nshe has confessed all.” So again they sent for Lucilla and ordered her\\r\\nto confess, and again she wept and declared that she could tell no\\r\\nmore.',\n",
              " 'Then the King said, “Well, let us give the woman her bag of gold\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 23]\\r\\n\\r\\nand let her go,” but the Queen stopped him, and said, “No indeed, let\\r\\nus first try shutting her up in prison for a bit, and see if that won’t\\r\\nopen her lips.”At first the King refused, for he said that Lucilla had done no wrong,\\r\\nbut the Queen insisted that she was deceiving them, and that her\\r\\ndancing must be witchcraft, and at last the King began to listen to\\r\\nher.',\n",

              " 'That is, if you will be brave, and\\r\\nnot cry.”“I will not cry one bit,” said Lucilla, and she sprang up, and held out\\r\\nher arms.At once she was lifted up, and felt herself going higher and higher,\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 5]\\r\\n\\r\\ntill she rested on one of the great windmill sails, and, with the\\r\\nlittle grey elves beside her, was sweeping through the air, clinging to\\r\\nthe sail.“She is quite good,” whispered one, as she held Lucilla in her tiny\\r\\nwhite arms.',\n",

              " 'Indeed I will not,”\\r\\nand she looked entreatingly from one to another of the elves.“But if you did,” said they, “if you broke your promise to us when\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 6]\\r\\n\\r\\nonce you had made it, we should punish you severely.”“But I promise faithfully,” repeated Lucilla, “I will never tell any\\r\\none.”“Well then, you may try,” they said.',\n",

              " 'But if you keep faith with us,\\r\\nthen the windfairies will never forget you, but will come to your help\\r\\nin your direst hour of need.”“Teach me, teach me,” cried Lucilla; “indeed I will never, never tell,\\r\\nand I long to dance as you do.”“Come then,” they said, and some came behind her, and some went in\\r\\nfront of her, and some took her arms and some her feet, and all at\\r\\nonce Lucilla felt as if she were made of feather-down.',\n",
              " 'She swayed up\\r\\nand down as lightly as they, and it seemed to her quite easy.',\n",

              " 'She grew up to be a beautiful young\\r\\nwoman, and her father was very proud of her.',\n",
              " 'She was as tall and as\\r\\nlithe as a willow wand, and when she ran or danced it seemed as if she\\r\\nwere as light as a feather blown in the wind.',\n",
              " 'There were few people\\r\\nto see her, or tell her she was beautiful, for save the fisher folk\\r\\nwho lived in little cottages on the beach, scarce anybody came to the\\r\\ndowns.',\n",
              " 'But all who saw her admired her beauty, and most of all her\\r\\nwonderful dancing.',\n",
              " 'Sometimes she would go out on the downs, and dance\\r\\nand run there by herself, and her father would look at her and say:\\r\\n“Heaven help the maid!',\n",
              " 'I don’t know whom she has learned it from, but\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 8]\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never seen a dancer who can come nigh her.” Then sometimes she\\r\\nwould go down to the sea-shore, and this she loved to do best of all,\\r\\nand there she would dance with the waves, and move with them as they\\r\\nslid up to her feet and drew back, and to those who watched, it seemed\\r\\nas if she and they were one together.The time came when her father wished her to be married, and among the\\r\\nyoung fishermen and the country folk who came to the mill from the\\r\\nfarms across the country, she had suitors enough, but always she said\\r\\nwhen a young man came to woo her, “First let me see how you can dance,\\r\\nfor as dancing is the thing I love best in the world, it would be a\\r\\npity that I and my husband should not be able to dance together,” and\\r\\nas none of them could dance as she did, she sent them all away, saying\\r\\nshe would wait for a husband till she could find a man who could dance\\r\\nto her liking.But one day there was a great storm, and a big ship was blown on to\\r\\nthe shore close to the mill, and among the sailors was a young fellow\\r\\nwith black curly hair and bright eyes and white teeth, and when he saw\\r\\nLucilla, he said to himself, “I will wed that girl and take her home\\r\\nfor my wife.” So one day as they sat on the downs together he begged\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pg 9]\\r\\n\\r\\nher to marry him, and go back with him to his own land; he said he\\r\\nwould give up going to sea, and would live with her in a little cottage\\r\\nand make their bread by fishing.',\n",
              " 'Then Lucilla said, as she had said\\r\\nto all her other suitors, “First let me see how you can dance, for I\\r\\nwill never marry any man who cannot dance with me.” The sailor swore he\\r\\ncould dance as well as any man in the world, for all sailors can dance,\\r\\nhe said, and they began to dance together on the downs.',\n",
              " 'The sailor\\r\\ndanced well and merrily, but Lucilla danced faster, and seemed as if\\r\\nshe were made of feather-down; and then the sailor, seeing that his\\r\\ndancing was as nothing to hers, caught her by the waist, and held her\\r\\nstill, crying, “My sweetheart, I cannot dance as you can, but my arms\\r\\nare strong enough to hold you still and keep you from dancing with any\\r\\nman but me.”So Lucilla married the sailor, and went with him to live in his little\\r\\ncottage by the sea, many miles away from the mill, and as her father\\r\\nwas growing old and no longer cared to work, he went with her too.',\n",
              " '[Pg 10]For some time the sailor and Lucilla lived together very happily, and\\r\\nthey had two little children, and her husband fished and sold his fish,\\r\\nand often still, Lucilla would go down to the waves and dance with them\\r\\nas she had done in her old home.',\n",

once a\\r\\nwindmill which stood on the downs by the sea  far from any town or\\r\\nvillage  and in which the miller lived alone with his little daughter \\r\\nHis wife had died when the little girl  whose name was Lucilla  was a\\r\\nbaby  and so the miller lived by himself with his child  of whom he was\\r\\nvery proud  As her father was busy with his work  and as little Lucilla\\r\\nhad no other children to play with  she was alone nearly all day \\r\\nand had to amuse herself as best she could  and one of her greatest\\r\\npleasures was to sit and watch the great sails of the windmill figures like them  and they\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 4 \\r\\n\\r\\nheld each other by the hand  and were dancing and springing from the\\r\\nground as lightly as if they had been made of feather down “Come  sisters  come ” cried the one nearest Lucilla  “See  here is a\\r\\nlittle human child out here alone at twelve o’clock at night  Come and\\r\\nlet us play with her ”“Who are you ” asked Lucilla  “my name is Lucilla  and I live in the\\r\\nmill with my father ”“We are windfairies ” said the first grey figure “Windfairies ” said Lucilla  “what are they ”“We blow the winds and sweep the earth  When there are many of us\\r\\ntogether we make a great hurricane  and human beings are frightened  We\\r\\nit is who turn your mill wheel for you  and make all the little waves\\r\\non the sea  See  if you will come with us we will take you for a ride\\r\\non one of the sails of your mill  That is  if you will be brave  and\\r\\nnot cry ”“I will not cry one bit ” said Lucilla  and she sprang up  and held out\\r\\nher arms At once she was lifted up  and felt herself going higher and higher \\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 5 \\r\\n\\r\\ntill she rested on one of the great windmill sails  and  with the\\r\\nlittle grey elves beside her  was sweeping through the air  clinging to\\r\\nthe sail “She is quite good ” whispered one  as she held Lucilla in her tiny\\r\\nwhite arms  “I really think we might teach her to dance  for she has\\r\\nnot cried at all ”“No  she would surely tell some one if we did ” said another  “Little\\r\\nhuman child  would you like us to teach you how to dance as we dance ”“Yes  yes ” cried Lucilla  and now they were sweeping down near the\\r\\nground  and the fairies slid off the sail with Lucilla in their arms \\r\\nand let her slide gently to earth  “Teach me to dance  I beg  I will\\r\\nnever tell anybody ”“Ah  but that is what all mortals say ” whispered one who had not\\r\\nspoken yet  “no mortal can keep a secret  Never yet was one known who\\r\\ncould be silent ”“Try me ” cried Lucilla again  “I will never tell  Indeed I will not ”\\r\\nand she looked entreatingly from one to another of the elves “But if you did ” said they  “if you broke your promise to us when\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 6 \\r\\n\\r\\nonce you had made it  we should punish you severely ”“But I promise faithfully ” repeated Lucilla  “I will never tell any\\r\\none ”“Well then  you may try ” they said  “Only remember  if you break\\r\\nyour word to us  and tell any mortal who it was that taught you how\\r\\nto dance  you will never dance again  for your feet will become heavy\\r\\nas lead  and not only that  but some great misfortune will overtake\\r\\nwhatever you love best in this world  But if you keep faith with us \\r\\nthen the windfairies will never forget you  but will come to your help\\r\\nin your direst hour of need ”“Teach me  teach me ” cried Lucilla  “indeed I will never  never tell \\r\\nand I long to dance as you do ”“Come then ” they said  and some came behind her  and some went in\\r\\nfront of her  and some took her arms and some her feet  and all at\\r\\nonce Lucilla felt as if she were made of feather down  She swayed up\\r\\nand down as lightly as they  and it seemed to her quite easy  Never\\r\\nhad she been so happy  and she would gladly have danced for hours  but\\r\\nsuddenly  just as the sun was beginning to show a red light in the\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 7 \\r\\n\\r\\nsky  she heard her father’s horse galloping over the downs  and in an\\r\\ninstant the windfairies had vanished When the miller came up to her  he was angry with her for being out on\\r\\nthe grass instead of warm in bed  but Lucilla dared not tell him what\\r\\nhad kept her  or say that she had been playing with windfairies Years passed  and Lucilla never saw the windfairies again  though she\\r\\nwatched for them every night  She grew up to be a beautiful young\\r\\nwoman  and her father was very proud of her  She was as tall and as\\r\\nlithe as a willow wand  and when she ran or danced it seemed as if she\\r\\nwere as light as a feather blown in the wind  There were few people\\r\\nto see her  or tell her she was beautiful  for save the fisher folk\\r\\nwho lived in little cottages on the beach  scarce anybody came to the\\r\\ndowns  But all who saw her admired her beauty  and most of all her\\r\\nwonderful dancing  Sometimes she would go out on the downs  and dance\\r\\nand run there by herself  and her father would look at her and say \\r\\n“Heaven help the maid  I don’t know whom she has learned it from  but\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 8 \\r\\n\\r\\nI have never seen a dancer who can come nigh her ” Then sometimes she\\r\\nwould go down to the sea shore  and this she loved to do best of all \\r\\nand there she would dance with the waves  and move with them as they\\r\\nslid up to her feet and drew back  and to those who watched  it seemed\\r\\nas if she and they were one together The time came when her father wished her to be married  and among the\\r\\nyoung fishermen and the country folk who came to the mill from the\\r\\nfarms across the country  she had suitors enough  but always she said\\r\\nwhen a young man came to woo her  “First let me see how you can dance \\r\\nfor as dancing is the thing I love best in the world  it would be a\\r\\npity that I and my husband should not be able to dance together ” and\\r\\nas none of them could dance as she did  she sent them all away  saying\\r\\nshe would wait for a husband till she could find a man who could dance\\r\\nto her liking But one day there was a great storm  and a big ship was blown on to\\r\\nthe shore close to the mill  and among the sailors was a young fellow\\r\\nwith black curly hair and bright eyes and white teeth  and when he saw\\r\\nLucilla  he said to himself  “I will wed that girl and take her home\\r\\nfor my wife ” So one day as they sat on the downs together he begged\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nher to marry him  and go back with him to his own land  he said he\\r\\nwould give up going to sea  and would live with her in a little cottage\\r\\nand make their bread by fishing  Then Lucilla said  as she had said\\r\\nto all her other suitors  “First let me see how you can dance  for I\\r\\nwill never marry any man who cannot dance with me ” The sailor swore he\\r\\ncould dance as well as any man in the world  for all sailors can dance \\r\\nhe said  and they began to dance together on the downs  The sailor\\r\\ndanced well and merrily  but Lucilla danced faster  and seemed as if\\r\\nshe were made of feather down  and then the sailor  seeing that his\\r\\ndancing was as nothing to hers  caught her by the waist  and held her\\r\\nstill  crying  “My sweetheart  I cannot dance as you can  but my arms\\r\\nare strong enough to hold you still and keep you from dancing with any\\r\\nman but me ”So Lucilla married the sailor  and went with him to live in his little\\r\\ncottage by the sea  many miles away from the mill  and as her father\\r\\nwas growing old and no longer cared to work  he went with her too  Pg 10 For some time the sailor and Lucilla lived together very happily  and\\r\\nthey had two little children  and her husband fished and sold his fish \\r\\nand often still  Lucilla would go down to the waves and dance with them\\r\\nas she had done in her old home  She tried to teach her little children\\r\\nto dance as she did  but they could not learn because the windfairies\\r\\nhad never touched them  But one winter her husband’s boat was dashed to\\r\\npieces  and the sea froze so that all the fish died  and they became so\\r\\npoor that they could barely get enough to eat  Then it chanced that a\\r\\nbig ship came to the village where they lived  and the captain wanted\\r\\nmen for a long journey  and her husband told Lucilla that he had best\\r\\ngo with him  and then he would have enough money to buy another boat \\r\\nand then next year they must hope for better luck  So Lucilla was left\\r\\nalone in the cottage with her father and her two little children  and\\r\\nshe felt very lonely and sad without her husband  and often she thought\\r\\nof the mill and the windfairies  and when the wind blew  she would go\\r\\ndown to the water’s edge and hold out her arms and pray them to take\\r\\ncare of her husband’s ship  and bring it safe home again  Pg 11 “Oh  kind windfairies ” she cried  “see  I have kept faith with you  so\\r\\ndo you now keep faith with me  and do me no hurt ” And often she would\\r\\ndance by the edge of the waves  as she used to do in her old home  and\\r\\nthink that the windfairies were dancing with her  and holding up her\\r\\nsteps Now it chanced that one day  as Lucilla was dancing on the shore  there\\r\\nrode by two horsemen  and they stopped and watched her as she danced \\r\\nwith the waves coming close to her feet  Then they got down from their\\r\\nhorses  and asked who she was  and where she had learned such dancing \\r\\nShe told them she was only the wife of a poor fisherman  but she had\\r\\ndanced for long years  since she was a little child  when she had lived\\r\\nin a windmill  on the downs far away  They rode away  but next day they\\r\\ncame again  and brought others with them  and begged Lucilla that she\\r\\nwould go down to the water’s edge and dance with the waves as she had\\r\\ndone yesterday  So she ran down the beach  and danced in time to the\\r\\nsea as it moved  and the strangers all applauded  and said to each\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 12 \\r\\n\\r\\nother  “It is wonderful  it is marvellous ”They then told her that they came from a country where the King loved\\r\\nnothing so much as beautiful dancing  and that he would give great sums\\r\\nof money to any one who danced well  and if she would go back with them\\r\\nto his court  and dance before the King  she should have a sack of gold\\r\\nto take home with her  and this would make her a rich woman  and her\\r\\nhusband would never have need to work any more At first she refused  and said her husband was away  and would not\\r\\nknow where she was gone  and she did not like to leave her two little\\r\\nchildren  but still the courtiers persuaded her  and said it would not\\r\\nbe for long  and her father persuaded her too  since he said it would\\r\\nmake them all rich if she brought home a sack of gold  So at last\\r\\nLucilla agreed that she would go back with them to the King’s court\\r\\nand dance there  but she made them promise that before the spring came\\r\\nthey would send her back to her own little cottage  On hearing this \\r\\nthe strangers were much delighted  and bid Lucilla make ready to start\\r\\nat once  and that night she said good bye to her little ones  and\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 13 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nleft them  to go with the travellers  Her eyes were red with crying at\\r\\nleaving her home  and before she started  she went out alone on to the\\r\\ncliffs  and stretched out her arms  and called to the windfairies to go\\r\\nwith her and help her  for she feared what she was going to do  and she\\r\\nbegged them to be true to her  as she had been true to them They sailed for many days  till at last they came to a country of which\\r\\nLucilla had never even heard  and to a big town  which seemed to her\\r\\nas if it must hold all the people in the world  so crowded was it  and\\r\\nabove the town on the hill  they pointed out to her a royal palace  and\\r\\ntold her it was where the King dwelt  and there she would have to dance\\r\\nere the week was out “And it is most lucky we saw you just now ” said they  “for the King is\\r\\njust going to be married  and in a few days the Princess will arrive \\r\\nand there will be festivities and rejoicing for days  and at some of\\r\\nthese you will appear before their Majesties  and be sure you dance\\r\\nyour very best ”Then Lucilla went with them into a great hall close to the palace \\r\\nwhere musicians were playing on every kind of instrument  and here the\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 14 \\r\\n\\r\\ncourtiers bid her dance on a platform at one end of the hall  in time\\r\\nto the music  and when they had seen it  the musicians one and all lay\\r\\ndown their instruments  and rose together  clapping and applauding  and\\r\\nall declared that it was the greatest of luck that the travellers had\\r\\nmet with Lucilla  and that it would delight the King more than anything\\r\\nthey had prepared for him By and by the Princess who was to marry the King arrived  and the\\r\\nwedding was celebrated with much magnificence  and after the wedding\\r\\nthere was a feast  and in the evening there was to be singing and\\r\\ndancing  and all sorts of play for the royal couple and the court to\\r\\nsee  and then Lucilla was to dance  The courtier who brought her wished\\r\\nher to be dressed in the most gorgeous dress  with gold and jewels  but\\r\\nshe pleaded that she might wear a light grey gown like the windfairies \\r\\nbecause she remembered how they looked when they danced on the downs When the evening came when she was to dance before the King  she threw\\r\\nwide her window and held out her arms  and cried out  “Now help me \\r\\ndear windfairies  as you have done before  keep faith with me  as I\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 15 \\r\\n\\r\\nhave kept faith with you ” But in truth she could scarce keep from\\r\\ncrying with thoughts of her husband at sea  and her little ones at the\\r\\ncottage at home The hall was brilliantly lighted  and in the middle on the throne sat\\r\\nthe King and the young Queen  The musicians began to play  and then\\r\\nLucilla stepped forth on the platform and began to dance  She felt as\\r\\nlight as the sea foam  and when she swayed and curved to the sound of\\r\\nthe music  it seemed to her as if she heard only the swish of the waves\\r\\nas they beat upon the shore  and the murmur of the wind as it played\\r\\nwith the water  and she thought of her husband out at sea  with the\\r\\nwind blowing his ship along  and of her little babies living in the\\r\\ncottage on the beach When she stopped  there was such a noise of applauding and cheering in\\r\\nthe hall  as had never been heard there before  and the King sent for\\r\\nher  and asked her where she came from  and who had taught her such\\r\\nwonderful steps  but she only answered that she was the daughter of a\\r\\npoor miller  who lived in a windmill  and she thought she must have\\r\\nlearnt to dance from watching the windmill’s sails go round  Every\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 16 \\r\\n\\r\\nnight the King would have her dance again and again  as he never tired\\r\\nof watching her  and every night Lucilla said to herself  “Now another\\r\\nnight is gone  and I am one day nearer to their taking me back to my\\r\\nown home and my children  with a bag of gold to give to my husband when\\r\\nhe comes back from sea ”The new Queen was a handsome woman  but she was very jealous  and it\\r\\nmade her angry that the King should admire the new dancer’s dancing so\\r\\nmuch  and she thought she would like to be able to dance like her  So\\r\\none evening when no one was watching her  she put on a big cloak that\\r\\ncovered her all over  and asked her way to where the dancer lived \\r\\nLucilla sat alone in the little house that they had given her to live\\r\\nin  and the Queen came in behind her  and took off her cloak  and\\r\\nbade her be silent and not say her name  for fear some one should be\\r\\nlistening and know that she was there “Now ” she said  “I have come to you that you may tell me  though no\\r\\none else knows it  who taught you to dance  that I may go and learn\\r\\nfrom them also to dance like you  for in the home that I come from  I\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 17 \\r\\n\\r\\nwas said to be the most graceful woman in the land and the best dancer \\r\\nso that there is no dancing that I cannot learn ”Lucilla trembled  but she answered “Your Majesty  I lived in a little windmill by the sea when I was a\\r\\nchild  far from teachers or dancers  but I watched the windmill sails\\r\\ngo round  morn  noon  and night  and perhaps it is that that taught me\\r\\nto dance as I do now  And if your Majesty wishes to learn to do what\\r\\nI do  I will gladly teach you all I know  and doubtless you will soon\\r\\nlearn to dance far better than I ”Upon this the Queen was delighted  and flung aside her cloak  and stood\\r\\nopposite to Lucilla  and begged her to begin to teach her at once  that\\r\\nshe might learn as soon as possible  All that evening they danced  but\\r\\nwhen the Queen thought she looked just as Lucilla did  she appeared to\\r\\nbe quite awkward and heavy beside her  and was dancing just as other\\r\\nmortals might  When she went away she was very much pleased  and said\\r\\nthat she would come twice more to learn from her  and then she was\\r\\nsure that she would be perfect  In her heart Lucilla was very much\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 18 \\r\\n\\r\\nfrightened  because she knew that the Queen did not dance as she did \\r\\nand never could  However  the next night she came again  and the next\\r\\nagain  and then there was to be a grand court ball  and at this the\\r\\nQueen thought she would first show her husband how she could dance \\r\\nThe King himself was fond of dancing  and danced well  although not\\r\\nhalf so well as Lucilla’s husband the sailor  and the Queen thought\\r\\nhow delighted he would be when he saw what a graceful wife he had got \\r\\nAs the ball began  all the fine people were saying to each other  it\\r\\nreally seemed silly to dance after they had seen the wonderful new\\r\\ndancer  but the Queen smiled and thought to herself  “Now they will see\\r\\nthat I can do quite as well as she ” When her turn came she tripped\\r\\nlightly forward and danced as best she could  and thought it was just\\r\\nlike Lucilla  and the courtiers said among each other  “Our new Queen\\r\\ndances well ” but no one thought of saying that it was like Lucilla’s\\r\\ndancing  and the King said nothing at all on the matter  therefore the\\r\\nQueen felt herself growing hot and angry  and she turned red and white\\r\\nby turns  Pg 19 “That lying wench has been tricking me ” she said to herself  “and\\r\\nshe has not taught me right at all  but I will punish her for her\\r\\ndeception  and soon she shall know what it is to deceive a Queen ”So the next day she went to her husband and said  “Husband  I have\\r\\nthought much of the new wonderful dancer whom we all admire so much \\r\\nand truly I have never seen any one on earth who could dance as she\\r\\ncan  but now I think we should do well before she goes back to her own\\r\\nhome to know who has taught her her marvellous art  so that we may have\\r\\nour court dancers taught  that they may be there to please us when she\\r\\nis gone  for really there is nothing on earth that cannot be learnt if\\r\\nit is taught in the right way ”The King agreed  and they sent for Lucilla  and the King asked her to\\r\\ntell him where she had learnt her dancing  that they might summon the\\r\\nsame teachers to teach their court dancers  But Lucilla answered as\\r\\nbefore—she did not know—she thought she must have learnt dancing from\\r\\nwatching the windmill sails going round  At this the King became angry \\r\\nand said  “That is nonsense  no one could learn dancing from looking\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 20 \\r\\n\\r\\nat windmill sails  neither was it possible that she  a poor miller’s\\r\\ndaughter  could have learnt such dancing by nature ” then he threatened\\r\\nher  that if she would not tell him the truth he should be obliged to\\r\\npunish her  and he said she should have a day to think of it in  but at\\r\\nthe end of the next day  he should expect her to tell him everything he\\r\\nwanted to know quite plainly When she was gone away the King said to the Queen  “Wife  if this\\r\\ndancer persists in her silence  and will not tell us how she has\\r\\nlearnt  there is another thing which we must do  We must keep her here\\r\\nto dance for us as much as we choose  and not let her return at all to\\r\\nthe home from which she came ”The Queen was silent for a little  but she felt very jealous at the\\r\\nthought of the dancer remaining at the court  so she nodded her head\\r\\nand said  “Yes  but I think she ought to tell us more about it  for\\r\\nmyself  I begin to think that it is witchcraft  and perhaps she has\\r\\nbeen taught by the Evil One  and then we shouldn’t like her to remain\\r\\nhere and dance to us however beautiful it be  for who knows what ill\\r\\nluck it might not bring upon us ” Upon this the King looked grave  and\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 21 \\r\\n\\r\\nsaid he did not believe much in ill luck or good luck  but he should be\\r\\nloth to lose the dancer  so they had better settle to keep her if she\\r\\ndeclined to tell them how the other dancers were to be taught Meantime Lucilla went back to her little house  and wept bitterly \\r\\n“Would that I had never left my babes and my home ” she cried  “for I\\r\\ncannot break my word to the windfairies  and if I did they might do\\r\\nsome terrible harm to my little ones or to my husband at sea  yet if I\\r\\nrefuse to tell them they will most likely put me into prison  and there\\r\\nI shall remain for my life  and my husband and children will never\\r\\nknow what has become of me ” And she knelt down before the windows and\\r\\nlifted her arms and cried out  “Oh  dear windfairies  I have not broken\\r\\nfaith with you  so don’t break faith with me  and come to my help and\\r\\nsave me in my trouble ”Next evening Lucilla went again before the King  and he said to her \\r\\n“Well  now will you tell us what we asked you last night  so that we\\r\\nmay send for your teachers  and have others taught to dance as you do ” Pg 22 “My gracious liege ” answered Lucilla  “I can tell you nothing that I\\r\\nhave not told you before  Since I was a child I have danced as I dance\\r\\nnow  and I watched the sails of my father’s windmill  and I danced in\\r\\ntime to the waves  and perhaps that is what taught me to keep time and\\r\\nstep so well  I was dancing by the sea shore when the travellers who\\r\\nbrought me here found me  and they promised me a bag of gold to take\\r\\nhome to my husband if I would come and dance at your Majesty’s court \\r\\nand now you have seen me dance  and I have done all I can do  so I\\r\\nentreat you to give me the bag of gold  and let me go home again ”The King was silent  but the Queen was still more angry  and in her\\r\\nheart was determined that Lucilla should never return to her home until\\r\\nshe had found out about her dancing  So when they were alone she said\\r\\nto her husband  “It is now quite clear  it is by witchcraft that this\\r\\nwoman has learned  and we should do very wrong if we let her go till\\r\\nshe has confessed all ” So again they sent for Lucilla and ordered her\\r\\nto confess  and again she wept and declared that she could tell no\\r\\nmore  Then the King said  “Well  let us give the woman her bag of gold\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 23 \\r\\n\\r\\nand let her go ” but the Queen stopped him  and said  “No indeed  let\\r\\nus first try shutting her up in prison for a bit  and see if that won’t\\r\\nopen her lips ”At first the King refused  for he said that Lucilla had done no wrong \\r\\nbut the Queen insisted that she was deceiving them  and that her\\r\\ndancing must be witchcraft  and at last the King began to listen to\\r\\nher  Also he was very angry with Lucilla for wanting to go home  and\\r\\nmuch disappointed to think he should see her dancing no more  so he\\r\\nconsented  and said that either she must tell him how it was she came\\r\\nto be able to dance better than anybody else in this world  and who\\r\\ntaught her  or else they should think her dancing witchcraft  and she\\r\\nmust go to prison and wait her punishment Poor Lucilla wept most bitterly  “Alas ” cried she to herself  “woe is\\r\\nme  for I dare not break faith with the windfairies  and yet if I do\\r\\nnot  I shall never see my husband or my babies again  for I fear lest\\r\\nthey may put me to death here ” Pg 24 However  she continued to be silent  and the King ordered her to be\\r\\nput into prison until she should speak out and tell them the truth \\r\\nand the guards came and led her away to prison  and locked her into a\\r\\ndark cell  It was dreary and cold  and the walls were so thick that\\r\\nshe could not hear any of the noises from without  and there was only\\r\\none little window  which was too high up for her to see through  Here\\r\\nshe lay and lamented  and almost wished she could die at once  for she\\r\\nbelieved that they would burn her  or drown her  and bitterly did she\\r\\ngrieve that she had left her home and her children Every day the King sent down to ask if she had changed her mind  but\\r\\nevery day she answered that she had nothing to say  One evening she sat\\r\\nin her dark cell alone  grieving as usual  when the prison door opened \\r\\nand there entered a woman wrapped in a cloak and with her face hidden\\r\\nby a mask  When she took off the mask Lucilla saw it was the Queen  and\\r\\nshe sprang up hoping that she had come to tell her that she was to be\\r\\nreleased  but the Queen said  “Now I have come to you alone that you\\r\\nmay tell me the truth  Who taught you to dance  and where can I learn\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 25 \\r\\n\\r\\nto do what you do  If you will tell me I will ask the King to forgive\\r\\nyou  and you shall have your bag of gold  and go when you like ”Then poor Lucilla began to cry afresh  and said  “My gracious lady \\r\\nI can tell you one thing that I have not yet told to any one  that\\r\\nis  that I did learn my dancing  but who told me  or how it was  is a\\r\\nsecret that I swore I would never tell to any one  And now I implore\\r\\nyour Royal Highness to let me go back to my fisherman husband  and my\\r\\nbabies  Alack  alack  it was an evil hour for me when I left my home ”Upon this the Queen became furious  but she hid her anger  and first\\r\\nshe tried to coax Lucilla to confess all  then she threatened her\\r\\nwith the King’s wrath  and then  as Lucilla still wept and said that\\r\\nshe could not break her promise  she started up in a rage  and said \\r\\n“Indeed  it is of little use  however much you love your husband and\\r\\nyour children  for you will never see them again  The King has settled\\r\\nthat you shall be killed this very week  so now you know what you have\\r\\ngained by your wicked obstinacy ” Pg 26 So the Queen returned to the King  and told him that the dancer had\\r\\nconfessed that she had learned her dancing  but she would not say from\\r\\nwhom  therefore it must be from the Evil One  and therefore there was\\r\\nnothing for it but that she should be killed  So they settled that\\r\\nfirst they would try to drown Lucilla  and if she were a witch she\\r\\nwould not sink  and the King gave orders that she should be taken out\\r\\nto sea next day and thrown overboard  and also that she should have\\r\\nheavy weights tied to her feet  and her arms should be bound to her\\r\\nsides Next morning the guards fetched her  and they bound her arms to her\\r\\nsides  and tied heavy weights to her feet  and they took her down and\\r\\nplaced her in a boat on the sea shore  and they rowed her out to sea \\r\\nand all along the beach stood crowds of people  shouting and jeering \\r\\nand calling out  “She is a witch  she is a witch  the King has done\\r\\nwell to have her killed ”“Alas  alas ” cried Lucilla  “what have I done to deserve this  surely\\r\\nI have done no wrong to be so cruelly treated  Dear windfairies  come\\r\\nto my help  for in truth now is the time of my direst need  and if you\\r\\ndesert me I am lost  but I pray you keep faith with me  as I have\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 27 \\r\\n\\r\\nkept faith with you ” Then  when they had rowed the boat out a little\\r\\nway  the guards seized her  and threw her into the water  and the salt\\r\\nwaves splashed over her face and through her hair  but in spite of the\\r\\nheavy weights on her feet she never sank  but felt as light as when she\\r\\ndanced with the waves on the sea shore by her home  and she knew that\\r\\nthe windfairies held her up  and the waves rocked her gently  and drew\\r\\nher in towards the land  and laid her on the sand  and all the crowd\\r\\nyelled with rage When they found that Lucilla could not be drowned both the King and\\r\\nQueen were very angry  and said that now it was quite clear that she\\r\\nwas a witch  and that she must be burnt  so they must take her back to\\r\\nprison  and arrange for her to be burnt in the market place  So Lucilla\\r\\nwas again taken back to her little dark cell  and she kneeled on the\\r\\nground and looked up to the window  and murmured  “Thank you  dear\\r\\nwindfairies  you have kept faith with me  as I have kept faith with\\r\\nyou ”Then again the guards came  and took her by the arms and led her to\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 28 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe market place  and here she saw a great pile of wood made  whereon\\r\\nshe was to be laid  and already men were busy setting fire to it \\r\\nBut as Lucilla and the guards came to the spot  there arose a little\\r\\nbreeze  and it blew on to the faces of the crowd who went to see her\\r\\nburnt  The men who were trying to light the pile of wood  said they\\r\\ncould not make it catch for the wind  when at last it did catch fire \\r\\nthe flames would not rise in the air  but were blown along the ground \\r\\nStill they brought Lucilla up to the pile  and placed her upon it  and\\r\\nthen the flames divided on each side  and were blown away from her all\\r\\nround  so she sat in the midst quite unhurt  Pg 29 \\nAt this the people all cried out  “Now we know that she really is a\\r\\nwitch  since she will not drown and the fire will not burn her ” and\\r\\nthey ran to tell the King and the Queen that the dancing woman did not\\r\\nmind the fire  but sat in the midst of it unhurt  On hearing this the\\r\\nKing and Queen came down to the market place together  and saw Lucilla\\r\\nsitting on the pile of wood  and the flames blown away from her on all\\r\\nsides  and causing a great hubbub  so they told the guards to take her\\r\\nback to prison and keep her there  till they could arrange for her to\\r\\nbe beheaded  And again Lucilla bent her head  and said  “Now I know \\r\\ndear windfairies  that you will never desert me  and I have nothing to\\r\\nfear  for while I keep faith with you  you will keep faith with me ” Pg 30 \\nBy now it was getting late in the day  and the King commanded that\\r\\nLucilla should not be executed till next day  and that the scaffold\\r\\nshould be erected in the market place  on which the block should be\\r\\nput  so that all the crowd might see  and both he and the Queen would\\r\\nbe there  But in order to give her one last chance that every one might\\r\\nsee how fair they were  the King offered that if she would confess \\r\\neven when she was upon the scaffold  who had taught her to dance  she\\r\\nshould be allowed to return whence she came  and take her bag of gold\\r\\nwith her  and therefore the bag of gold was placed on the scaffold so\\r\\nthat all the people might see  and the bag was so large that Lucilla\\r\\ncould scarcely lift it That evening Lucilla felt no fear  and she would have slept calmly in\\r\\nher cell  but the wind was beginning to blow in all directions  and all\\r\\nround she heard it roaring  and the trees were bending and breaking\\r\\nin the gale  When the morning came  the King and Queen said to each\\r\\nother  “This is the morning when they should execute the dancer  but\\r\\nit will be hard to get her on to the scaffold with a gale like this\\r\\nblowing ” However  the guards came to Lucilla’s cell  and took her out\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 31 \\r\\n\\r\\nas before  and led her towards the market place  though they had much\\r\\nado to get along  for the wind blew so hard that they could scarce keep\\r\\nupright in it  All along the coast the little boats were being blown in\\r\\nto shore  and there were big ships  which had been driven in  to take\\r\\nrefuge from the storm  But Lucilla felt no fear  only she looked up to\\r\\nthe wind  and in her heart she said  “Now  dear windfairies  help me\\r\\nfor the last time  and keep faith with me  as I have kept faith with\\r\\nyou ”Near the shore came a big ship with shining white sails  riding over\\r\\nthe crested waves  and although all the other boats seemed troubled by\\r\\nthe wind  and some were dismasted and others were wrecked  this boat\\r\\nseemed no way hurt by it  and the people who saw it called out  “What\\r\\na gallant ship it was  and how brave the captain must be  who knew\\r\\nso well how to manage wind and water ” But when they knew that the\\r\\ntime had come for Lucilla to be beheaded  the people did not trouble\\r\\nfurther about the boats  and in spite of the gale they flocked to the\\r\\nmarket place  and crowded round the scaffold on which was the block  Pg 32 Then the guards and Lucilla mounted the scaffold  and Lucilla began to\\r\\nfear that at last the windfairies had forsaken her  and she wept and\\r\\nheld out her arms  and cried out  “Oh  dear windfairies  indeed I have\\r\\nkept my faith with you  surely  surely you will keep yours with me ”\\r\\nIn spite of the terrible gale  the King and the Queen came down to the\\r\\nmarket place  though they could scarce see or hear for the wind  though\\r\\nall the time the sun was shining and the sky was blue  Then the guards\\r\\nbid Lucilla kneel down and place her head upon the block  and the bag\\r\\nof gold was beside her  and they said  “This is your last chance  speak\\r\\nnow and confess the truth to the King  and here is your gold  and you\\r\\nshall go ” And Lucilla answered as before  “I have spoken the truth \\r\\nand there is no more that I can tell  since I have sworn never to say\\r\\nfrom whom I learnt my dancing ”Then the executioner lifted the axe in the air  but before it fell \\r\\nthere came a sudden roar of wind  and the axe was swept from his hand \\r\\nand the houses in the market place tottered and fell  and high up\\r\\non the hill the palace was a mass of ruins  Only Lucilla knelt upon\\r\\nthe scaffold unhurt  for the King and the Queen and all the people\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 33 \\r\\n\\r\\nwere blown right and left  amidst the ruins of the houses  and no one\\r\\nthought of anything save how they could save themselves Then Lucilla lifted her head and looked out to sea  and saw the big\\r\\nship coming in  and she heard the sailors cry  “Heyday  these poor folk\\r\\nare in a sad plight  we had better go and help them ” and they all\\r\\ntrooped up into the market place  and the wind troubled them no more\\r\\nthan it had troubled their ship  But when Lucilla looked at them  the\\r\\nfirst whom she saw was her husband  and she gave a great cry  and held\\r\\nout her arms  and called out  “Now  dear windfairies  do I indeed know\\r\\nthat you have kept faith with me  and saved me in my direst hour of\\r\\nneed ”Then she told her husband all that had happened  and showed him the\\r\\nbag of gold  and prayed him take her back to her little cottage and\\r\\nher babies by the sea  and she knew that it was the windfairies that\\r\\nhad brought her husband to her  for he told her that whatever way they\\r\\nsteered the ship it would only take one course  and the wind had blown\\r\\nit without their guidance straight\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 34 \\r\\n\\r\\nto the town where she was to be killed So Lucilla and her husband took the bag of gold  and went back to the\\r\\nlittle cottage by the sea shore  and her father and her babies  and the\\r\\nKing and the Queen and all the rest of the people were left to build up\\r\\ntheir town as best they could  and Lucilla never saw nor heard of them\\r\\nany more  but lived happily with her husband for the rest of her life  Pg 35 \\nOnce upon a time\\r\\nthere lived a young girl called Kesta who was the dairy maid at a large\\r\\nfarm  She milked the cows and made the cheese and butter  and sometimes\\r\\ntook them into the town to sell for her master On the farm worked a man named Adam  He drove in the cows for Kesta to\\r\\nmilk and watched her milking them  As she was a comely looking girl and\\r\\ndid her work well  he thought she would make him a good wife  so one\\r\\nday he said  “Kesta  how would you like to marry me  and then we can\\r\\nsave our money and some day buy a farm for ourselves  and I should be\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 36 \\r\\n\\r\\na farmer and you should be the farmer’s wife  and have servants to wait\\r\\non you ”“That I should like very much ” said Kesta  “but I can’t say yes  at\\r\\nonce  To morrow I am going to town with my cheeses  when I come back I\\r\\nwill give you an answer ”At night Kesta looked into her glass and said  “I wonder why Adam\\r\\nwishes to marry me  but as he does  most likely some better man would\\r\\nlike to do so  it would be folly to marry him till I see if I can’t do\\r\\nbetter  I must look about me when I go to town to morrow  and see who I\\r\\ncan meet ”In the morning she dressed herself with great care in her best clothes \\r\\nand set out for the town with the cheeses in a basket under her arm \\r\\nWhen she had got a little way she passed a mill  and the miller all\\r\\nwhite with flour stood in the yard directing his men  He was an oldish\\r\\nman  and his wife was recently dead  and Kesta thought as she drew\\r\\nnear  it would be a better thing to marry him than to marry poor Adam \\r\\nso she said  “Good day  would you kindly let me rest a little ” Pg 37 “Certainly  my girl ” said the miller  “you seem to be out of breath ”“And well I may be ” said Kesta  “such a run as I have had  I’ve come\\r\\nfrom the farm yonder  and it was as much as I could do to get away  for\\r\\nthe farmer’s man was very angry because I would not marry him  and of\\r\\ncourse I am too good for him  a pretty girl like me ”“Are you really a pretty girl ” said the miller  “let me see  perhaps\\r\\nyou are  Well  if you are too good for the farmer’s man perhaps\\r\\nyou would suit me  How would you like to marry me  and live in the\\r\\nmill house yonder ”“I think I should like it well ” said Kesta  “but I have some business\\r\\nin the town  and must go there first  so I’ll stop here and tell you as\\r\\nI come back ” So she said good bye  and went on her way feeling very\\r\\nmerry “It would be much better to marry the miller than to marry Adam  but\\r\\nwho knows if I may not do better than either  so I must not be in any\\r\\nhurry ” So she walked on  and near to the town she met a man on a white\\r\\nhorse  and saw it was the bailiff of the great Duke at the Palace  “Who\\r\\nknows but that he may want a wife ” she said to herself  “I can but\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 38 \\r\\n\\r\\ntry ” So she sat down by the road side and called out  “Ah me  what a\\r\\nthing it is to be a poor girl who has to run away from all the men she\\r\\nmeets ”“Why ” cried the bailiff  stopping his horse  “Why have you to run  who\\r\\ntries to hurt you ”“No one tries to hurt me ” said Kesta  “but I have to run from men who\\r\\nwant to marry me  because I am so pretty  At first it was a man at our\\r\\nfarm  and now it is the miller  who would not let me pass his door\\r\\nunless I promised to come back and marry him  but I am far too good for\\r\\nsuch as he ”“Is this really so ” cried the bailiff  who hated the miller  “did the\\r\\nmiller really want to marry you  If you’re too good to marry him  it\\r\\nmay be you would suit me ”“Indeed ” said Kesta  “I think that might do well  for I should live\\r\\nin a nice house and have plenty of servants  But I have to go into the\\r\\ntown on business  and you’re sure to be somewhere about here  and when\\r\\nI come back we will arrange it ” So she set off  leaving the bailiff\\r\\nchuckling at the thought of how angry the miller would be if he married\\r\\nKesta  Pg 39 On went Kesta in high good humour  “Now am I indeed doing well ” said\\r\\nshe  “how clever I was not to marry Adam before I came to town ”\\r\\nPresently she reached the town  and in the high street she passed the\\r\\nbank  and the banker himself stood in the doorway  He was fat and ugly\\r\\nand old  but his hands were covered with rings  and Kesta knew his\\r\\npockets were full of gold  Kesta said  “It would be a fine thing to\\r\\nmarry him  and I could hold up my head with any one  I think I’ll speak\\r\\nto him  as it would be folly to pass him without trying ” So she gave a\\r\\nloud sigh and said  “Alack a day  how hard is my lot ”“Why  what is wrong  my pretty lass ” said the banker “Pretty you may well say ” answered Kesta  “Would I were not so  for\\r\\nthence come all my troubles ”“And what are they ” asked the banker “Only wherever I go  I have no peace  for all the men want to marry me \\r\\nFirst it is the farmer  then the miller  and lastly the duke’s bailiff \\r\\nwho would scarcely let me pass on the road till I had promised him  and\\r\\nof course it is impossible  and I am much too pretty for any of them ” Pg 40 “Is this really true ” cried the banker  “if so  there must be\\r\\nsomething very superior about you  Perhaps you would be good enough for\\r\\nme  How would you like to be my wife  and ride in a fine carriage  and\\r\\nwear silk gowns all day ”“Nay  that would be much more fitting ” cried Kesta  “and from the\\r\\nfirst I thought you would be much more suitable to be my husband than\\r\\nany of the others I have met  but I must go down the town first  so I\\r\\nwill come in here on my way back ” So she went on till she came to a\\r\\ngreat square in front of the barracks where the soldiers were drilling \\r\\nwith their helmets and swords glittering in the sun  and at their head\\r\\nrode the General of the army  His voice was hoarse with shouting at his\\r\\nmen  and he swore dreadfully  but he was covered with gold  and looked\\r\\nvery grand  “Now supposing he has no wife ” thought Kesta  “it would be\\r\\na really fine thing to marry him  I can but try ” So she waited till\\r\\nthe soldiers were marching into the barracks  and then  when he was\\r\\nriding away  she went so close under the horse’s feet that he shouted\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 41 \\r\\n\\r\\nto her in case she should be run over  “Alas  what a life is mine ” she\\r\\ncried very loud that he might hear  “hunted here and there till I don’t\\r\\nknow where I go ”“Why  who hunts you ” cried the General angrily  “what nonsense you\\r\\ntalk  my good girl ”“How dare you say I talk nonsense ” cried Kesta  “when it is as much as\\r\\nI can do to get through your town for the men who want me to stop and\\r\\nmarry them ”“And why do they want you to marry them ” asked the General “Because I’m so pretty  of course ” said Kesta promptly  and she took\\r\\noff her hat and looked up at the General “I don’t think you are so pretty ” he said “But I am ” cried Kesta angrily  “and it’s only stupid people who don’t\\r\\nsee it  Go and ask the men in the town  First it was a man at the farm \\r\\nthen the miller  then the duke’s bailiff  then the banker—they all\\r\\nwanted to marry me  and I am much too good for any of them ”“If this is all true ” said the General  “of course you must be\\r\\nexceedingly pretty  and as you say you are much too good for them \\r\\nperhaps you might suit me  How would you like that ” Pg 42 “That might be better ” said Kesta  “and as you wish it very much I\\r\\nwill agree  and I hope you will try to make me a good husband  but I am\\r\\nobliged to go a little further on important business  and I will meet\\r\\nyou here on my way back ” and on she went laughing to herself  “Indeed\\r\\nI am fortunate ” thought she  “and as they all seem willing to marry\\r\\nme why should I not try higher  and see what the Duke himself would\\r\\nsay  There is nothing like being practical  and it would be downright\\r\\nsilly not to speak to the Duke now I am here ” By this time she had\\r\\ncome to the Duke’s palace  so she stopped a servant who was coming out\\r\\nand asked if he were at home  for she said  “I have special business\\r\\nwith him ” “He is sitting by the stream in the garden  where he sits\\r\\nfishing all day  and you can go and speak to him if you choose ” said\\r\\nthe servant  So Kesta went through the courtyard into the garden  and\\r\\nstraight on to where the Duke sat beside the stream with a long rod in\\r\\nhis hand fishing  He was dressed all in green  and seemed to be half\\r\\nasleep  and Kesta came quite near him before he saw her  Then she\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 43 \\r\\n\\r\\nsaid  “Ah  pity me  your Grace  and listen to my sad story ”“Good gracious  who are you —don’t you know I am the Duke ” said he “And that is why I have come to you to ask you to protect me from all\\r\\nthe men who pursue me ” said Kesta “Why do they pursue you ” asked the Duke “Because I am so pretty ” replied Kesta  “They all want to marry me \\r\\nfirst the man at the farm  then the miller I met on the road  then your\\r\\nbailiff  then the banker  then the General of your army  and he would\\r\\nonly let me go when I promised to go back to him ”“The General ” said the Duke  “Is this true  does he really want to\\r\\nmarry you ”“Of course he does ” said Kesta  “if you doubt what I say you had\\r\\nbetter send to the town and ask ”“Indeed ” said the Duke  “I should not have thought you so very pretty \\r\\nbut if what you say is true you must be  I’m not sure if it would not\\r\\nsuit me to marry you myself  but mind  I shall be exceedingly angry if\\r\\nI find you have not told me the truth  and they did not want to marry\\r\\nyou  Of course you would be delighted to marry me and be the Duchess ” Pg 44 “Aye  that I should ” cried Kesta  and she grinned with delight Then the Duke took from his side a horn and blew it loudly  There came\\r\\nfrom the palace four pages  dressed in blue and gold  who stood in a\\r\\nrow to receive his orders  “See ” cried the Duke  “I am going to marry\\r\\nthis lady  who everybody thinks is very beautiful  so see that you\\r\\ntreat her with respect  and go to the palace and bid them to prepare a\\r\\nfeast and fitting clothes for the bride  and tell the chaplain to be\\r\\nready  for I mean to marry her at once ”“And now ” he said to Kesta  when all his pages had returned to the\\r\\npalace  “come and sit by me and watch me fish till all is ready ”So Kesta sat by his side and watched him fishing with his long rod  but\\r\\nafter a time she grew tired of being silent  and said  “What have you\\r\\ncaught ”“Nothing yet ” said the Duke “Then why do you go on ” asked she “Because I’m sure to catch something soon  and it’s amusing  Wouldn’t\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 45 \\r\\n\\r\\nyou like to hold the rod a little ”“Yes  very much ” answered Kesta  who was afraid of offending him  So\\r\\nshe put out her hand to take the rod  and as she did so the basket fell\\r\\nfrom her arm and the cheeses rolled out “What are those round balls ” asked the Duke  “and what an odd smell\\r\\nthey have ”“They are my cheeses ” cried Kesta  “I made them yesterday  and was\\r\\ntaking them to sell  when——”“Good gracious  you made them ” cried the Duke with a scream  “Then\\r\\nyou must be a common dairy maid  and your hands are quite rough \\r\\nHow terrible  And I was just going to marry you  How dare you think\\r\\nyourself good enough to marry me ” and he sprang to his feet in a\\r\\ntowering passion  and seizing his horn blew it so loudly that the four\\r\\npages ran up in great alarm  “Hunt her away ” cried the Duke  “she is\\r\\nan impostor—a common farm wench and makes cheeses  She thought herself\\r\\ngood enough to be the Duchess ”Away flew Kesta  with the pages after her hooting and shouting  “Down\\r\\nwith the impertinent hussy who wanted to marry the Duke  a common\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 46 \\r\\n\\r\\ndairy maid who makes cheeses ”On rushed Kesta till she came to the General’s house  and at his window\\r\\nhe sat in his fine uniform  He sat waiting for her  but when he saw the\\r\\npages behind her he called  “Hey dey  what is all this fuss about ”“It is nothing ” said Kesta  “See  I have come back to marry you as I\\r\\npromised ”But here the pages shouted  “Away with the impertinent dairy maid  who\\r\\nthought herself good enough to marry the Duke ”“And wouldn’t the Duke marry her ” asked the General “Of course not  she is nothing but a farm wench ” cried the pages  “and\\r\\nshe is to be chased from the town for her impertinence ”“And so she shall ” cried the General  “she thought she was fit for me\\r\\ntoo—it is disgraceful ” and he cried to some soldiers who stood by his\\r\\ndoor  “Here  my men  help to chase this good for nothing hussy out of\\r\\nthe town ”But before he had finished Kesta was running down the street with all\\r\\nher might to the banker’s  At last she came to the banker’s big square\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 47 \\r\\n\\r\\nhouse standing beside the bank  and on the steps was the banker himself\\r\\nin his shiny black clothes with gold rings on his hands “Here I am ” cried Kesta  “and let me in quickly  for I am out of\\r\\nbreath with running ”“Why have you hurried so ” cried the banker  and as he spoke the pages\\r\\nand the soldiers came round the corner  “and what is all this shouting\\r\\nfor ”“Nay  how should I know ” cried Kesta  running into the house But up came her pursuers  crying  “Away with her  down with her ”“Who is it you are calling after ” asked the banker “That wench in the yellow dress who has gone into your house ”“Why  what has she done ” he asked “Why  she thought herself good enough to marry the Duke and the\\r\\nGeneral  and she is to be hooted out of the town for her impudence ”“But didn’t the General want to marry her ” asked the banker “Our General ” cried the soldiers angrily  “why  she’s only a\\r\\ndairy maid  and not fit for him ” Pg 48 “Then I’m sure she can’t be good enough for me  for I’m quite as good\\r\\nas he ” said the banker  and he ran into the house in a great rage \\r\\ncrying  “Begone  you impertinent jade  how dare you think yourself good\\r\\nenough for me to marry ” It chanced at this moment that the clerks were\\r\\ncoming out of the bank next door  and when he saw them he cried  “Here \\r\\nmy good fellows  help to chase this minx from the town  she wishes to\\r\\nbe my wife  when she is nothing but a common dairy maid ” On this the\\r\\nclerks burst out laughing  and one and all ran after Kesta  who ran\\r\\nwith all her might and main “It’s too hard ” sobbed she  “what have I done to be treated like\\r\\nthis ” But run as fast as she might she could not reach the bailiff’s\\r\\nhouse before them  and the pages  soldiers  and clerks were all close\\r\\nto her  shouting and laughing “Why  what’s the matter ” cried the bailiff  “and why are you shouting\\r\\nat this poor maid ”“Why ” said they  “she wanted to marry first the Duke  and the General \\r\\nand the banker  and of course they would not have her  because she is\\r\\nonly a common dairy wench ”“What impertinence ” cried the bailiff  “and  now I come to think of\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 49 \\r\\n\\r\\nit  she asked to marry me too  indeed she merits punishment for such\\r\\nbehaviour ” and seeing some of his farm people close at hand  he bid\\r\\nthem run after Kesta and drive her out of the town  But this time she\\r\\nhad started first  and had got on to the mill before they could reach\\r\\nher  and she ran into the garden where the miller was  “Well  I’m glad\\r\\nto see you back ” said he  “but how hard you have run ”“I was in such a hurry to get back  Now let’s go into the house ” she\\r\\nsaid “Come along ” said the miller  “but what are all those people shouting\\r\\nfor ”“’Tis only the farmers bringing home pigs from the market ” said Kesta \\r\\nbut she felt frightened  for she heard the people calling after her “Pigs don’t make a noise like that ” said the miller  “I will go and\\r\\nsee what it is about ” And when he heard that they were all shouting\\r\\nat Kesta  he flew into a violent rage and cried  “If she wasn’t good\\r\\nenough for the bailiff I’m sure she’s not fit for me ” and he called\\r\\nto some of his men who were working at the mill  “See there  my men \\r\\ndo you see that girl  throw some flour at her  for she is an impudent\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 50 \\r\\n\\r\\nhussy  and asked me to marry her ”Away flew Kesta again  and after her came all the crowd in a long line \\r\\n“How unfortunate I am ” she sobbed  “but anyhow I can go back to Adam \\r\\nhe’s sure to be glad to have me ” and on she sped  and at last she came\\r\\nto the farm and ran in  calling to Adam “Is that you  Kesta ” cried Adam  coming to meet her  and kissing her \\r\\n“I’m glad to see you  but why are you so hot ”“It is the sun  it was so strong ” said Kesta “Then sit down and grow cool ” said Adam  “But I wonder what all that\\r\\nshouting outside can be ”“It is only people making holiday ” cried Kesta  But for all she could\\r\\nsay Adam went out to ask the people what they wanted at the farm “We want nothing at the farm ” they cried  “but we followed that\\r\\nimpudent wench dressed in yellow ”“Why  what has she done ” asked Adam “Done ” they cried  “Why  she came up to the town and asked to marry\\r\\nthe miller  and the banker  and the bailiff  and the General  and even\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 51 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Duke himself  so she deserves to be punished for her presumption ”Then Adam looked very grave  and went back to the farm and said \\r\\n“Indeed  Kesta  I cannot marry you now  since you’ve been to the town\\r\\nand tried to get a finer husband than me ” and he went back to his\\r\\nwork  and left Kesta sitting all alone  and there she sat and cried\\r\\nby herself  and did not get any husband after all  because she was so\\r\\nfalse and vain  Pg 52 Once there was\\r\\na tree standing in the middle of a vast wilderness  and beneath the\\r\\nshade of its branches was a little pool  over which they bent  The pool\\r\\nlooked up at the tree and the tree looked down at the pool  and the\\r\\ntwo loved each other better than anything else on earth  And neither\\r\\nof them thought of anything else but each other  or cared who came and\\r\\nwent in the world around them “But for you and the shade you give me I should have been dried up by\\r\\nthe sun long ago ” said the pool  Pg 53 “And if it were not for you and your shining face  I should never have\\r\\nseen myself  or have known what my boughs and blossoms were like ”\\r\\nanswered the tree Every year when the leaves and flowers had died away from the branches\\r\\nof the tree  and the cold winter came  the little pool froze over and\\r\\nremained hard and silent till the spring  but directly the sun’s rays\\r\\nthawed it  it again sparkled and danced as the wind blew upon it \\r\\nand it began to watch its beloved friend  to see the buds and leaves\\r\\nreappear  and together they counted the leaves and blossoms as they\\r\\ncame forth One day there rode over the moorland a couple of travellers in search\\r\\nof rare plants and flowers  At first they did not look at the tree  but\\r\\nas they were hot and tired they got off their horses  and sat under the\\r\\nshade of the boughs  and talked of what they had been doing  “We have\\r\\nnot found much ” said one gloomily  “it seemed scarcely worth while to\\r\\ncome so far for so little ”“One may hunt for many years before one finds anything very rare ”\\r\\nanswered the elder traveller  “Well  we have not done  and who knows\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 54 \\r\\n\\r\\nbut what we may yet have some luck ” As he spoke he picked up one of\\r\\nthe fallen leaves of the tree which lay beside him  and at once he\\r\\nsprang to his feet  and pulled down one of the branches to examine it \\r\\nThen he called to his comrade to get up  and he also closely examined\\r\\nthe leaves and blossoms  and they talked together eagerly  and at\\r\\nlength declared that this was the best thing they had found in all\\r\\ntheir travels  But neither the pool nor the tree heeded them  for the\\r\\npool lay looking lovingly up to the tree  and the tree gazed down at\\r\\nthe clear water of the pool  and they wanted nothing more  and by and\\r\\nby the travellers mounted their horses and rode away The summer passed and the cold winds of autumn blew “Soon your leaves will drop and you will fall asleep for the winter \\r\\nand we must bid each other good bye ” said the pool “And you too when the frost comes will be numbed to ice ” answered the\\r\\ntree  “but never mind  the spring will follow  and the sun will wake us\\r\\nboth ” Pg 55 But long before the winter had set in  ere yet the last leaf had\\r\\nfallen  there came across the prairie a number of men riding on horses\\r\\nand mules  bringing with them a long waggon  They rode straight to the\\r\\ntree  and foremost among them were the two travellers who had been\\r\\nthere before “Why do they come  What do they want ” cried the pool uneasily  but\\r\\nthe tree feared nothing  The men had spades and pickaxes  and began to\\r\\ndig a deep ditch all round the tree’s roots  and then they dug beneath\\r\\nthem  and at last both the pool and the tree saw that they were going\\r\\nto dig it up “What are you doing  Why are you trying to wrench up my roots and to\\r\\nmove me ” cried the tree  “don’t you know that I shall die if you drag\\r\\nme from my pool which has fed and loved me all my life ” And the pool\\r\\nsaid  “Oh  what can they want  Why do they take you  The sun will come\\r\\nand dry me up without your shade  and I never  never shall see you\\r\\nagain ” But the men heard nothing  and continued to dig at the root of\\r\\nthe tree till they had loosened all the earth round it  and then they\\r\\nlifted it and wrapped big cloths round it and put it on their waggon\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 56 \\r\\n\\r\\nand drove away with it Then for the first time the pool looked straight up at the sky without\\r\\nseeing the delicate tracery made by the leaves and twigs against the\\r\\nblue  and it called out to all things near it  “My tree  my tree  where\\r\\nhave they taken my tree  When the hot sun comes it will dry me up  if\\r\\nit shines down on me without the shade of my tree ” And so loudly it\\r\\nmourned and lamented that the birds flying past heard it  and at last\\r\\na swallow paused on the wing  and hovering near its surface  asked why\\r\\nit grieved so bitterly  “They have taken my tree ” cried the pool  “and\\r\\nI don’t know where it is  I cannot move or look to right or left  so I\\r\\nshall never see it again ”“Ask the moon ” said the swallow  “The moon sees everywhere  and she\\r\\nwill tell you  I am flying away to warmer countries  for the winter\\r\\nwill soon be here  Good bye  poor pool ”At night  when the moon rose  and the pool looked up and saw its\\r\\nbeautiful white face  it remembered the swallow’s words  and called out\\r\\nto ask its aid “Find me my tree ” it prayed  “you shone through its branches and know\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 57 \\r\\n\\r\\nit well  and you can see all over the world  look for my tree  and tell\\r\\nme where they have taken it  Perhaps they have torn it in pieces or\\r\\nburnt it up ”“Nay ” cried the moon  “they have done neither  for I saw it a few\\r\\nhours ago when I shone near it  They have taken it many miles away and\\r\\nit is planted in a big garden  but it has not taken root in the earth \\r\\nand its foliage is fading  The men who took it prize it heartily  and\\r\\nstrangers come from far and near to look at it  because they say it is\\r\\nso rare  and there are only one or two like it in the world ”On hearing this the pool felt itself swell with pride that the tree\\r\\nshould be so much admired  but then it cried in anguish  “And I shall\\r\\nnever see it again  for I can never move from here ”“That is nonsense ” cried a little cloud that was sailing near  “I was\\r\\nonce in the earth like you  To morrow  if the sun shines brightly  he\\r\\nwill draw you up into the sky  and you can sail along till you find\\r\\nyour tree ”“Is that true ” cried the pool  and all that night it rested in peace\\r\\nwaiting for the sun to rise  Next day there were no clouds  and when\\r\\nthe pool saw the sun shining it cried  “Draw me up into the sky  dear\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 58 \\r\\n\\r\\nSun  that I may be a little cloud and sail all the world over  till I\\r\\ncan find my beloved tree ”When the sun heard it  he threw down hundreds of tiny golden threads\\r\\nwhich dropped over the pool  and slowly and gradually it began to\\r\\nchange and grow thinner and lighter  and to rise through the air  till\\r\\nat last it had quite left the earth  and where it had lain before \\r\\nthere was nothing but a dry hole  but the pool itself was transformed\\r\\ninto a tiny cloud  and was sailing above in the blue sky in the\\r\\nsunshine  There were many other little clouds in the sky  but our\\r\\nlittle cloud kept apart from them all  It could see far and near over a\\r\\ngreat space of country  but nowhere could it espy the tree  and again\\r\\nit turned to the sun for help  “Can you see ” it cried  “You who see\\r\\neverywhere  where is my tree ”“You can’t see it yet ” answered the sun  “for it is away on the other\\r\\nside of the world  but presently the wind will begin to blow and it\\r\\nwill blow you till you find it ”Then the wind arose  and the cloud sailed along swiftly  looking\\r\\neverywhere as it went for the tree  It could have had a merry time if\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 59 \\r\\n\\r\\nit had not longed so for its friend  Everywhere was the golden sunlight\\r\\nshining through the bright blue sky  and the other clouds tumbled and\\r\\ndanced in the wind and laughed for joy “Why do you not come and dance with us ” they cried  “why do you sail\\r\\non so rapidly ”“I cannot stay  I am seeking a lost friend ” answered the cloud  and\\r\\nit scudded past them  leaving them to roll over and over  and tumble\\r\\nabout  and change their shapes  and divide and separate  and play a\\r\\nthousand pranks For many hundred miles the wind blew the little cloud  then it said \\r\\n“Now I am tired and shall take you no further  but soon the west wind\\r\\nwill come and it will take you on  good bye ” And at once the wind\\r\\nstopped blowing and dropped to rest on the earth  and the cloud stood\\r\\nstill in the sky and looked all around “I shall never find it ” it sighed  “It will be dead before I come ”Presently the sun went down and the moon rose  then the west wind began\\r\\nto blow gently and moved the cloud slowly along  Pg 60 “Which way should I go  where is it ” entreated the cloud “I know  I will take you straight to it ” said the west wind  “The\\r\\nnorth wind has told me  I blew by the tree to day  it was drooping  but\\r\\nwhen I told it that you had risen to the sky and were seeking it  it\\r\\nrevived and tried to lift its branches  They have planted it in a great\\r\\ngarden  and there are railings round it and no one may touch it  and\\r\\nthere is one gardener who has nothing to do but to attend to it  and\\r\\npeople come from far and near to look at it because it is so rare  and\\r\\nthey have only found one or two others like it  but it longs to be back\\r\\nin the desert  stooping over you and seeing its face in your water ”“Make haste  then ” cried the cloud  “lest before I reach it I fall to\\r\\npieces with joy at the thought of seeing it ”“How foolish you are ” said the wind  “Why should you give yourself up\\r\\nfor a tree  You might dance about in the sky for long yet  and then you\\r\\nmight drop into the sea and mix with the waves and rise again with them\\r\\nto the sky  but if you fall about the tree you will go straight into\\r\\nthe dark earth  and perhaps you will always\\r\\nremain there  for at the roots of the tree they have made a deep hole\\r\\nand the sun cannot draw you up through the earth under the branches ” Pg 61 62  Pg 63 “Then that will be what I long for ” cried the cloud  “For then I can\\r\\nlie in the dark where no one may see me  but I shall be close to my\\r\\ntree  and I can touch its roots and feed them  and when the raindrops\\r\\nfall from its branches they will run down to me and tell me how they\\r\\nlook ”“You are foolish ” said the wind again  “but you shall have what you\\r\\nwant ”The wind blew the cloud low down near the earth till it found itself\\r\\nover a big garden  in which there were all sorts of trees and shrubs \\r\\nand such soft green grass as the cloud had never seen before  And there\\r\\nin the middle of the grass  in a bed of earth to itself  with a railing\\r\\nround it so that no one could injure it  was the tree which the cloud\\r\\nhad come so far to seek  Its leaves were falling off  its branches were\\r\\ndrooping  and its buds dropped before they opened  and the poor tree\\r\\nlooked as if it were dying “There is my tree  my tree ” called the cloud  “Blow me down  dear\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 64 \\r\\n\\r\\nwind  so that I may fall upon it ”The wind blew the cloud lower and lower  till it almost touched the top\\r\\nbranches of the tree  Then it broke and fell in a shower  and crept\\r\\ndown through the earth to its roots  and when it felt its drops the\\r\\ntree lifted up its leaves and rejoiced  for it knew that the pool it\\r\\nhad loved so had followed it “Have you come at last ” it cried  “Then we need never be parted again ”In the morning when the gardeners came they found the tree looking\\r\\nquite fresh and well  and its leaves quite green and crisp  “The cool\\r\\nwind last night revived it ” they said  “and it looks as if it had\\r\\nrained too in the night  for round here the earth is quite damp ” But\\r\\nthey did not know that under the earth at the tree’s roots lay the\\r\\npool  and that that was what had saved the tree And there it lies to this day  hidden away in the darkness where no\\r\\none can see it  but the tree feels it with its roots  and blooms in\\r\\nsplendour  and people come from far and near to admire it  Pg 65 \\nOnce there lived a\\r\\nyoung girl called Nanina  who kept sheep for an old farmer  One day he\\r\\nsaid to her  “Nanina  I’m going away to buy pigs at a market far off \\r\\nand I shall be away one whole month  so be sure and take good care of\\r\\nthe flock  and remember  there are six sheep and eight lambs  and I\\r\\nmust find them safe when I return  And mind \\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 66 \\r\\n\\r\\nNanina  that whatever you do  you don’t go near the old palace on the\\r\\nother side of the hill  for it is filled with wicked fairies who might\\r\\ndo you an ill turn ” Nanina promised  and her master started The first day all went well  and she drove the flock in safely at\\r\\nnight  but the next day she found it dull sitting on the hillside\\r\\nwatching the lambs at play  and wondered why her master had told her\\r\\nalways to keep on that side  and away from the old palace on the other “If it is filled with fairies ” quoth she  “it won’t hurt me just to\\r\\nlook at it  I should like to see a fairy ” So she drove her flock to\\r\\nthe other side of the hill  and sat looking at the old palace that was\\r\\nhalf in ruins  but was said to be lit up quite brightly every night\\r\\nafter it was dark “I wonder if it really is lit up ” said Nanina  “I should like to see ”\\r\\nSo she waited on that side of the hill till the sun went down  and\\r\\nthen she saw a bright light appearing in one of the palace windows \\r\\nAs she stood and watched  the front door opened  and out there came a\\r\\nshepherd boy followed by a flock of black goats  Nanina stared at him \\r\\nfor she had never seen any one so beautiful before  He was dressed in\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 67 \\r\\n\\r\\nglittering green  and wore a soft brown hat trimmed with leaves under\\r\\nwhich his curls hung down  In one hand he held a crook and in the\\r\\nother a pipe  and as he drew near  he began to play the pipe and dance\\r\\nmerrily  while the goats behind him skipped and danced too  Nanina had\\r\\nnever seen such goats  they were jet black  with locks curling and\\r\\nthick and soft as silk  As she listened open mouthed to the music of\\r\\nthe pipe  she heard it speak words in its playing —The shepherd boy danced lightly to where she\\r\\nstood  and louder and louder sounded the pipe \\r\\nand still it said—Nanina gaped to see the goats dance and spring\\r\\nin time to the music  and so cheering it was  that\\r\\nshe felt her own feet beginning to move with it \\r\\nThe shepherd made her a low bow and offered\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 68 \\r\\n\\r\\nher his hand  and she placed hers in it  and off they\\r\\nstarted together  Nanina’s feet felt as light as\\r\\nif they had been made of cork  and she laughed\\r\\nwith glee as she bounded on  and as she danced\\r\\nwith the shepherd  so her flock began to move\\r\\ntoo  and thus they went  followed by the black\\r\\ngoats and sheep all skipping merrily  “If my\\r\\nflock follow me there can be no harm ” thought\\r\\nNanina  and on they kept in time to the wonderful\\r\\ntune—Whither they went she knew not  she thought of nothing but the joy of\\r\\ndancing to the wonderful music  but suddenly  just ere sunrise  the\\r\\nshepherd stopped  and dropped her hand and gave one long slow note on\\r\\nthe pipe  at which the goats gathered round him  and before she knew\\r\\nwhere they were going  they had disappeared into the palace  Then she\\r\\nwas in a terrible fright  for she saw the sun beginning to rise  and\\r\\nfound the whole night had passed  when she thought she had only been\\r\\nten minutes  She counted her sheep  and  alas  there was one lamb\\r\\nmissing  Pg 69  Pg 70 She sought everywhere for it  but no trace of it was to be seen  Then\\r\\nshe drove all the others back to the farm and watched them  falling\\r\\nhalf asleep  for she was weary with the dancing  But when evening\\r\\ncame  and she had slept some time  she said to herself  “Surely the\\r\\nbest plan would be to go back to the old palace  and see if I can see\\r\\nthe shepherd and the black goats again ” So just about sunset she\\r\\nreturned to the palace  and again the door opened  and the beautiful\\r\\nshepherd boy came out with the black goats following  But when he began\\r\\nto play on his pipe  and the goats to dance  Nanina forgot all about\\r\\nthe lost lamb and danced with him as before  Again they danced till\\r\\nmorning  and then he left her suddenly  and she found that another lamb\\r\\nhad disappeared  Then she wept and lamented  and declared that the next\\r\\nnight she would only watch the shepherd and nothing would make her\\r\\ndance  and again the next night the same thing happened  when once she\\r\\nheard the pipe  Nanina could not keep still  and another lamb was lost \\r\\nThis went on to the end of a fortnight  when there was only one of the\\r\\nflock left  Then she was terribly frightened  for her master would soon\\r\\nreturn  and she did not know what she should say to him  But still she\\r\\nwent back and sat by the old palace  and when the shepherd came out \\r\\nand she heard the music  she could not refrain from dancing  and in\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 71 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe morning the last lamb had gone All the day Nanina wandered about and cried  but no sheep were to be\\r\\nfound  At last  when she was quite weary  she sat down beneath a beech\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 72 \\r\\n\\r\\ntree near the palace  and leaned her head against its trunk sobbing \\r\\nThen she saw that someone had torn down the lowest branches of the\\r\\ntree and they were hanging down broken  She raised them and tied them\\r\\nup  so that they would grow together  and as she did so she heard a\\r\\nshadowy voice whisper  “Thank you  Nanina  Nanina  don’t dance ” She\\r\\nlooked about but there was nobody there  and again she heard a whisper \\r\\n“Nanina  don’t dance ” The voice came from the beech tree  and among\\r\\nthe leaves she saw a small twisted face looking at her  “Thank you \\r\\nNanina  for saving my bough ” said the tree  “and if you mind me  you\\r\\nshall get all your sheep back again ”“My sheep ” cried Nanina  “Only tell me  and I will do anything ”“Then you must not dance  Every time you refuse to dance with the\\r\\nfairy  one of your flock will be returned ”“But how can I refuse to dance ” cried Nanina  “for as I hear the\\r\\npipe beginning  my feet begin to move of themselves  it is no use my\\r\\ntrying ” and she cried aloud “Bury your feet in the earth like my roots ” whispered back the voice \\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 73 \\r\\n\\r\\n“Dig a hole deep down  and I will hold your feet so that you shall not\\r\\nmove them  only you must bear the pain  and not mind if you walk lame\\r\\nafterwards  for I shall hold them very tight  and it will hurt you ”“Hurt me as you please ” cried Nanina  “and I shan’t mind  If only I\\r\\ncan get back my sheep I will bear any pain ” So she knelt beneath the\\r\\ntree  and dug a deep hole in the ground among its roots  and then she\\r\\nplaced her feet among the loose earth  and she felt something moving\\r\\nnear them which tightened around and drew them far down into the\\r\\nground  and held them as if they were bound with cords  She saw the\\r\\nlights in the windows of the palace  and the door opened  “Hold me \\r\\nhold me fast ” she cried  “for when I hear the music I shall begin to\\r\\ndance ” The tree said nothing  but she felt its roots tightening so\\r\\nthat she could not move  The door of the palace opened as before  and\\r\\nthe beautiful shepherd  followed by his goats and her sheep  came out \\r\\nand she heard once more the sound of the wonderful pipe  and he danced\\r\\nstraight up to the tree beneath which she stood  and held out his hand\\r\\nto her  Nanina felt as if her feet were beginning to move under the\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 74 \\r\\n\\r\\nearth  but the roots of the tree held them so firmly that she could not\\r\\nstir one inch  Still the shepherd danced before her  and as she saw\\r\\nhim springing in front  with the flocks behind him following him  she\\r\\ngrew quite wild to dance  and tried her hardest to break her feet free\\r\\nfrom the roots which held them  but in vain  though she almost screamed\\r\\nwith the pain they cost her  For hours the shepherd danced in front\\r\\nof her  till  as before  the pipe sounded forth one long note  and he\\r\\ndisappeared  but this time not all the flock went with him  for beside\\r\\nher was left one of her own little lambs  and when she saw it she\\r\\ncried for joy  She felt the roots releasing their hold of her feet \\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 75 \\r\\n\\r\\nand she drew them out of the earth  and they were all blue and bruised\\r\\nwhere they had been held  She drove home the lamb and fastened it into\\r\\nthe sheep pen  but her feet were so stiff and swelled that she limped\\r\\nas she walked  Next night she went back to the beech tree  and again\\r\\nslipped her feet into its roots  and felt them twist around them  but\\r\\nthis time the poor feet were so sore that she cried when they touched\\r\\nthem  Again the fairy appeared  and again she heard the pipe  and her\\r\\nlonging to dance was worse than ever  but the roots clutched her and\\r\\nwould not let her stir  When the pipe ceased and the fairy disappeared \\r\\nanother of her lambs was left with her  and she drove it home as she\\r\\nhad done the first  but she had to go very slowly on account of her\\r\\ncrushed feet The same thing happened the next night and the next  till all the flock\\r\\nhad returned save one  and Nanina’s feet were so bad that she could\\r\\nscarcely hobble  for they were crushed and bleeding  and she wondered\\r\\nwhether she would walk lame all the days of her life On the last evening she limped down to the tree almost crying with\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 76 \\r\\n\\r\\npain  When she sat down by its trunk she heard the soft sighing voice\\r\\nsaying  “Never mind  Nanina  to night is the last  and though it will\\r\\nhurt you the most  it will soon be past ” So she slipped her feet into\\r\\nthe earth once more  though she shrank as they touched it  and directly\\r\\nthe sun had set  the lights appeared in the palace windows  and out\\r\\ncame the shepherd with all his black goats and her one white sheep\\r\\nfollowing him  He looked more beautiful than ever  for he had a crown\\r\\nset with jewels  and was dressed in scarlet and gold  but when the pipe\\r\\nbegan to play it was not merry dance music it made  but long sad notes \\r\\nlike a funeral march  yet Nanina’s feet would have moved in spite of\\r\\nherself  and she would have marched in time to them  had not the roots\\r\\ntightened like cords and held her down  Tears of pain ran down her\\r\\ncheeks  and she sobbed  and instead of the joyous words what the music\\r\\nsaid was— Pg 77 78  Pg 79 Presently the music grew quicker  and her longing to move with it\\r\\ngrew stronger  She swayed herself about  and cried and screamed as\\r\\nthe fairy and flock danced  now solemnly and slowly  now joyously and\\r\\nwildly  Just when she felt that she could bear it no longer there came\\r\\none long low note on the pipe  and with a mighty crash like thunder the\\r\\nshepherd and the goats disappeared  and not only had they gone  but the\\r\\nwalls of the old palace had fallen  and nothing was left of it but a\\r\\nheap of stones  Beside her on the grass was the last of her lost sheep \\r\\n“Good bye  Nanina ” said the voice from the beech tree  “now you have\\r\\nall your flock again ” and she felt the roots loosen round her feet \\r\\nbut when she looked at them she found that her legs were wounded and\\r\\nbleeding  where she had dashed them about in trying to dance  She knelt\\r\\ndown and smoothed over the earth where it was torn up among the trees \\r\\nand she put her arms round the trunk and kissed and thanked it for\\r\\nhaving helped her  but the voice did not speak again  Then she drove\\r\\nhome the last sheep  but she had to go on her hands and knees  for her\\r\\nfeet were too bad to walk Next day when the farmer came home  he was well pleased that she had\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 80 \\r\\n\\r\\nkept his flock safe  but he would fain know how she had got such sore\\r\\nfeet that for long she must walk lame  “Of a truth  master ” she quoth \\r\\n“it was in saving the lambs when they got into dangerous places ”Underneath the beech tree  where Nanina’s feet had bled among the\\r\\nearth  there sprang up pretty little scarlet flowers  and whenever\\r\\nshe passed and saw them she remembered how she had been punished for\\r\\ndisobeying her master  and made up her mind never to do so again  Pg 81 \\nIn a little village there lived a young potter  who made his living by\\r\\nmaking all sorts of earthenware  He took the clay  and made it into\\r\\nshapes on the wheel  and then baked his cups and jars in a kiln  He\\r\\nmade big jugs and little jugs  and basins and cups and saucers  and\\r\\nindeed every sort of pot or jar that could be wanted  He was very\\r\\nfond of his work  and was always thinking of how to make new shapes \\r\\nor colour his jars with pretty colours  It was a very tiny village\\r\\nhe lived in  and he worked at throwing his pots on his wheel by the\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 82 \\r\\n\\r\\nroad side  but people came from many other villages and towns to buy\\r\\nhis ware  Once a year there was a big fair  held in the town near  and\\r\\njust before it  the potter was always very busy making new pots and\\r\\njugs to sell there  A few nights before the fair was to be held  he was\\r\\nhard at work  trying to finish a number of little bowls  so he sat at\\r\\nhis wheel late in the evening after the sun was set  All day long the\\r\\nroad had been gay with folk coming to the fair  some were in carts \\r\\nand some were on foot  and there were a number of gipsies in caravans \\r\\nbringing all sorts of goods to sell  Most of them went through the\\r\\nvillage and on to a big common a little further on  where they got out\\r\\nof their carts and put up tents  to sleep in while the fair went on \\r\\nThe potter was so busy with his little basins on his turning wheel\\r\\nthat he did not hear the sound of footsteps  and when he looked up  he\\r\\nwas surprised to see a young gipsy girl standing near  watching him \\r\\nShe was quite young  and had big black eyes  and rosy round cheeks \\r\\nand her black hair was twisted up in little red beads and chains  She\\r\\nwas dressed in some very gay stuff  and round her neck was a gold\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 83 \\r\\n\\r\\nnecklace  and on her fingers and arms were rings and bracelets “That should be a fine cup ” said the girl  “since you keep your eyes\\r\\non it and can look at nothing else ”“I keep my eyes for my work  that I may do it well ” said the potter \\r\\n“for I live by my work  and neither by stealing nor begging ”“But I fancy many others can do your work as well  or better than you ”\\r\\nanswered the gipsy  “What can your cups do when they are finished  I\\r\\ndon’t hear you say anything to them  so I should think they would be\\r\\nstupid cups—only fit to drink out of ”“And what else should they be for ” asked the potter angrily  “What do\\r\\nyou mean by saying that you don’t hear me saying anything to my cups \\r\\nI don’t think you know what you are talking about  It is nonsense  and\\r\\nyou are talking nonsense ”“My grandfather used to make pots on a wheel ” said the gipsy  and she\\r\\nlaughed low  and showed her white teeth in the moonlight  “ah  but he\\r\\nknew how to do them  and he had charms to say to them when he threw\\r\\nthem  And one of his cups would make you wise if you drank out of it \\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 84 \\r\\n\\r\\nand another would give you your true love’s heart if she drank from it \\r\\nand another would make you forget everything—yes  even your true love \\r\\nand all your mirth and all your sorrow  and I think that was the best\\r\\ncup of all ” and again the gipsy laughed in the moonlight  and sang a\\r\\nlittle song to herself as she sat herself down before the potter “Now this is real child’s talk ” said the potter very impatiently \\r\\n“’Tis easy to say your grandfather knew how to do all this  but why\\r\\nshould I believe you  and because your grandfather may have been able\\r\\nto throw a bowl upon the wheel  that doesn’t make you know anything\\r\\nabout the craft  or how it is done ”“Nay  but he taught me too ” said the gipsy  “Give me a piece of your\\r\\nclay  and let me come to your wheel and you shall see ”At first the potter thought she was talking nonsense  but to his great\\r\\nsurprise she took hold of the clay in her little brown hands  and\\r\\nmoulded and modelled it with the greatest skill  Then she placed it on\\r\\nthe wheel and threw a little jug  and he wondered to see how deft she\\r\\nwas  Pg 85 “Now I will make you a little bowl ” she said  and then she made jugs\\r\\nand pots and jars  far more quickly and skilfully than the potter could\\r\\nhave done  “And now I will colour them too ” she cried  “See  I shall\\r\\ncatch the colour from the moon  and to morrow you can put them into\\r\\nyour kiln and bake them  and you may be sure that you have never had\\r\\nsuch pots there before ” Then she put her little brown hands out into\\r\\nthe moonlight  and they were covered with rings which glittered and\\r\\nshone  but as she held up her palms to the moon’s rays  it seemed to\\r\\nthe potter as if they too were full of some strange glittering liquid \\r\\n“And now ” she said  “see  I will put it on to your pots  and I should\\r\\nthink I had taught you that I know more about your trade than you do\\r\\nyourself ” And she took the pots in her hands and rubbed her palms over\\r\\nthem  and she traced patterns on them with her fingers The potter looked at her and felt almost angry  but she only laughed in\\r\\nhis face “And now one last thing ” she cried  “and that is  that I will make\\r\\nyou a cup that has a spell in it  and it shall be a present for you\\r\\nto remember me by  It will be very plain  and there will be no gay\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 86 \\r\\n\\r\\ncolours in it  but when you give it to your true love to drink from \\r\\nif once you have drunk from it yourself  you will have all her heart \\r\\nbut beware that she doesn’t take a second draught  For though the first\\r\\ndraught that she drinks will be drunk to love  the second draught will\\r\\nbe drunk to hate  and though she have loved you more than all else on\\r\\nearth  all her love will turn to hate when she drinks again  And as you\\r\\nare so ignorant how to make bowls and cups  you will not know how to\\r\\nfashion one so as to win back her love again ”The potter stared in silence  while the gipsy took another bit of\\r\\nclay and placed it upon the wheel  and then she bent her head  which\\r\\nglittered with beads and coins  low over it  and placing her rosy lips\\r\\nclose to the mouth of the cup  sang some words into it  while she\\r\\nmoulded it with her hands  and turned the wheel with her foot  It was\\r\\nin some strange language that the potter had never heard before “Good bye ” she said presently  “Now  there  that is for you  and be\\r\\nsure you do not sell the little brown cup  but keep it and give it to\\r\\nyour true love to drink out of  but only one draught  for if there\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 87 \\r\\n\\r\\nare two maybe you will need the gipsy’s help again ” Then she laughed \\r\\nand nodding her head over her shoulder  tripped lightly away in the\\r\\nmoonlight while the potter stared after her At first he thought he had been asleep  but there around him stood the\\r\\nlittle rows of jugs and pots which the gipsy had made  and truly they\\r\\nwere beautifully done  He took them up  and turned them over in his\\r\\nhand  and wondered at their shape and workmanship “To morrow ” he said  “I will put them into the kiln  and see how they\\r\\ncome out  She certainly was a clever wench  and knew her work  but as\\r\\nfor her talk about having coloured them  that was all nonsense  and as\\r\\nfor breathing spells and charms into the cups  why it is like baby’s\\r\\ntalk ”But next day when the pots were baked  the potter was even more\\r\\nsurprised  for they had the most wonderful colours that he had ever\\r\\nseen  silver  blue  grey and yellow  in all sorts of patterns  all save\\r\\nthe little brown cup  which was the last the gipsy had made  But when\\r\\nhe looked at it the potter felt a little uncomfortable  and began to\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 88 \\r\\n\\r\\nwonder if it really did contain the charm as she had declared When the fair began  the potter placed all the gipsy’s wares on a stall\\r\\nwith his own  and marked them with very high prices  but had he asked\\r\\nthree times as much he could have got it  for there were some rich folk\\r\\nfrom the big houses who came to the fair  and they at once bought them\\r\\nall up  declaring that such pots and jugs they had never seen  At this\\r\\nthe potter was well pleased  and found that he had made more money than\\r\\nhe had earned in many a long month past  but when people wanted him to\\r\\nmake them more like them  he was obliged to shake his head  and say \\r\\n“That he was very sorry  but he had had them coloured from afar  and he\\r\\ndid not know where he could now have them done ” Of the gipsy he saw\\r\\nnothing more  though he looked for her everywhere during the three days\\r\\nin which the fair lasted  but she was not to be seen  and when the fair\\r\\nwas over  and the other people were packing their carts and vans to go\\r\\non their way  he saw very many gipsies  and supposed that she had gone\\r\\nwith some of them  without giving him the chance of speaking to her\\r\\nagain  Pg 89 Years went by  and the potter never heard anything more of the gipsy \\r\\nindeed he would have thought it had all been a dream if it had not been\\r\\nfor the little brown pot standing on the shelf  Sometimes he took it\\r\\nup  and looked at it  and wondered when he saw how well and cleverly it\\r\\nwas made  He still laughed when he remembered what the gipsy had said\\r\\nabout leaving a charm in it  for though he himself had drunk out of it\\r\\nmany times  he never thought it had brought any spell on him One year when the fair was being held  the potter was at his place\\r\\nas usual with his stall covered with pots  and there came and placed\\r\\nherself beside him at the next stall a woman with some spinning wheels \\r\\nHer stall was covered with fine linen cloths woven in pretty patterns \\r\\nand so fine and well wrought were they  that many people wanted\\r\\nto buy them  With her were her two daughters  and one sat at the\\r\\nspinning wheel and spun the flax  and the other had a hand loom and\\r\\nwove it when it was spun to show the good folk how the cloths were\\r\\nmade  Both were pretty girls  but the girl who had the hand loom had\\r\\nthe sweetest face the potter had ever seen  Her eyes were very blue \\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 90 \\r\\n\\r\\nand her hair was like golden corn  and when she smiled  it was as if\\r\\nthe sun shone  The potter watched her as she sat weaving  and could\\r\\nnot keep his eyes from her or attend properly to his own pots  or to\\r\\nthe people who wanted to buy them  Every day he watched the young girl\\r\\nat her work  for the fair lasted for a week  and the more he looked at\\r\\nher the more he wanted to look  till at last he said to himself that\\r\\nsomehow or other he must get her for his wife  so when the fair was\\r\\ndone he begged her to marry him  and to remain with him  and he said he\\r\\nwould always work for her  and she should want for nothing  The mother\\r\\nwas a poor widow  and she and her daughters made their bread by going\\r\\nabout the country spinning and weaving  and she would have been quite\\r\\nwilling that the potter should marry her daughter  but the girl only\\r\\nlaughed  and said that she scarcely knew the potter  but when she came\\r\\nback again the next year to the fair  she would give him his answer  So\\r\\nthe widow and her two daughters went away  and no sign of them was left\\r\\nwith the potter  save a lock of golden hair  which he had begged from\\r\\nthe daughter  Pg 91 The year passed away  but to the potter it seemed the longest year he\\r\\nhad ever lived  He pined for the time to come when the fair should\\r\\nbe held  and the widow and her daughters should return  As the time\\r\\ndrew near he got down the brown cup  and looked at it again and again \\r\\n“Nay ” he said  “what harm could it do  the gipsy said it would give me\\r\\nmy true love’s heart if she drank out of it after I had drunk  and I\\r\\nhave drunk out of it many a time  I don’t believe it  but all the same\\r\\nit would be no harm for her to drink from it ”And so when the fair was opened  he took the brown cup down with him \\r\\nand stood it upon the stall with his other ware  The spinning woman and\\r\\nher two daughters came back with their fine cloths  and their wheel\\r\\nand their loom  and when he saw the golden haired girl  he loved her\\r\\nstill more than before  for he thought her eyes were bluer and her\\r\\nsmile was brighter  He watched her all the time as she sat weaving  but\\r\\nsaid nothing  but when the fair was over  and they were packing their\\r\\ngoods to go on their way  he pressed the maid for her answer  Still\\r\\nshe hesitated  and then the potter took the little brown cup off his\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 92 \\r\\n\\r\\nstall  and poured into it some choice wine  and said to her “If then you wish to go away  and never see me again  I pray you drink\\r\\none draught  in remembrance of the happy days we have had together ”The young girl took the cup  but no sooner had she tasted it than she\\r\\nput it down and turned her eyes on the potter  and said in a low voice “I will stay with you always  if you want me  and will be a true wife\\r\\nto you  and love you better than anything on earth ”So the potter married her  and she went to live in his little cottage Time passed  and the potter and his young wife lived together very\\r\\nhappily  and every day he thought her fairer and sweeter  And they had\\r\\na little baby girl with blue eyes like its mother’s  and the potter\\r\\nthought himself the happiest man on earth  and the little brown pot\\r\\nstood on the shelf  and the potter looked at it  and still he would not\\r\\nbelieve about the charm  for he said to himself  “My wife loved me for\\r\\nmy own sake  and not for any silly charm or nonsense ” Pg 93 4  Pg 95 So for a time all things went well  but there came a day when the\\r\\npotter had to go to a neighbouring town and leave his wife at home\\r\\nalone all day  When he was gone she sat by the window with her little\\r\\nchild  and presently there came up outside a dark  rough looking man \\r\\nwith a wicked face  and he looked at her as she sat rocking the cradle \\r\\nand thought she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen on earth \\r\\nWhen he looked at her the potter’s wife was frightened  but when he\\r\\ntold her he was very hungry  and begged her for food and drink  she\\r\\nrose  for her heart was tender  and she fetched him bread and meat  and\\r\\nspread them on the table before him  So the rough man came into the\\r\\ncottage and sat at the table  and ate the potter’s bread and meat  and\\r\\ndrank his wine  “And who is your husband  and where is he ” he said  “I\\r\\nam sure he is a lucky man to have such a wife and such a home ”“Yes  truly ” said the potter’s wife  “We are very happy  and we love\\r\\neach other dearly  and we really have nothing else to wish for ”Then the gipsy man said  “But your dress is plain  and your rooms are\\r\\nbare  now  were you the wife of some wealthy man  he would give you\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 96 \\r\\n\\r\\npearls and diamonds for your neck  and beautiful silks and satins ”“No  but I don’t want them ” said the potter’s wife smiling  “My\\r\\nhusband works very hard  and he gives me all he can  and I am quite\\r\\ncontent with it ”“And you say he is a potter  then what sort of things does he make ”\\r\\nasked the gipsy man as he cast his eyes about the room  and they lit\\r\\nupon the little brown jug standing upon the shelf  “And did he make the\\r\\nlittle bowl there ”“I don’t know ” said his wife  and she took it down and turned it about\\r\\nin her hand  “I suppose so  but he has told me it was very old ”The gipsy man seized it eagerly  and poured wine in it  and looked\\r\\ninside it  and then he laughed  and stooping his head over it  said a\\r\\nfew words  and then laughed again “I have seen cups like this before ” he said  “And they are worth a\\r\\nmint of money  though you would not think it  And have you never drunk\\r\\nout of it  Has it not been used ”“I don’t drink from it ” said the potter’s wife  “but I believe I did\\r\\nso once  and that was on the day when I promised my husband I would be\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 97 \\r\\n\\r\\nhis wife ”Then the gipsy laughed again and again  “See ” he said  “I am going a\\r\\nlong way off  perhaps to die by cold and hunger by the road side  while\\r\\nyou and your husband are cosy and warm  You set small store by this\\r\\ncup  but it may be that in foreign countries I could sell it for what\\r\\nwould keep me for many a long day  Give it to me  I pray you  that I\\r\\nmay take it with me ”The potter’s wife hesitated and trembled  She was afraid of the man \\r\\nand she thought he had a hard  bad face  but she did not want to seem\\r\\nunkind “Well  take it ” she said  “but why should you want it ”Then the gipsy man came and caught her by the arm  “Now ” he said \\r\\n“you are the fairest woman I have ever seen  and I am going away  and\\r\\nshall never see you again  So I beg you wish me God speed  and drink my\\r\\nhealth out of the little brown cup you have given me  And if your lips\\r\\nhave touched it  it will be the dearest thing I have on earth ” Pg 98 Then the potter’s wife was still more frightened  and trembled more\\r\\nthan before  But the man looked so dark and threatening  that she did\\r\\nnot like to refuse him  and she took the cup in her hand “And then you will go on your way ” she said “And then I shall go on my way ” cried the gipsy  “And you will wait\\r\\nhere till your husband comes  whom you love more than anything else on\\r\\nthis earth ”Then the potter’s wife bent her head and tasted the wine out of the\\r\\ncup  and wished the gipsy happiness  And when she had done so he\\r\\nlaughed again  long and low  till her heart sank with fear  and he\\r\\npicked up the cup and put it into his bundle  and went his way  Then\\r\\nthe potter’s wife sat down by the cradle  and almost cried  she knew\\r\\nnot why  and the whole room seemed cold  and when she looked out at the\\r\\nsunshine it looked dark  and she bent over the baby in the cradle with\\r\\nher tears falling “Alack ” she cried  “why doesn’t my husband come home  Where is he\\r\\ngone  How cruel it is to leave me all alone here  so that any rough\\r\\nman may come into the house  In truth I don’t think he can love me\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 99 \\r\\n\\r\\nmuch  since all he thinks of is to go away and leave me  and as for me \\r\\nsurely I could have had many a better husband  and one who should have\\r\\nloved me more  How foolish I was to marry him ”Thus she sat and lamented all day  and in the evening  when the potter\\r\\ndrove up to his door and cried out “Wife  wife ” she wouldn’t go out\\r\\nto receive him  And when he came in to their little sitting room  he\\r\\nfound her with tears in her eyes  sitting lamenting and complaining \\r\\nWhen he went up to her to take her in his arms and kiss her  she turned\\r\\naway from him and would not let him touch her  and the potter  who had\\r\\nnever seen his wife cross or angry  knew that there must be something\\r\\nwrong  She must be ill  he thought  to morrow or the next day she will\\r\\nbe well again  So he urged her to rest well  and took no notice of her\\r\\nangry words  but the next day  and the next  there was no change  and\\r\\nthings were growing from bad to worse  For now the wife wouldn’t speak\\r\\nto him at all  and when she came nigh him she looked at him with anger \\r\\nand would not even suffer him to touch the hem of her dress  Then the\\r\\npotter began to think of the little brown cup  and he looked up at the\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nshelf and saw that it was not there  and he began to feel very much\\r\\nalarmed “Why ” he said  “what has become of my little old brown cup that used\\r\\nto stand up on the shelf ”“I gave it to a gipsy man ” she answered scornfully  “He seemed to like\\r\\nit  and I didn’t see that I was obliged to keep all the rubbish that\\r\\nyou had in the house ”Then the potter groaned within himself and said “But did you just take it off the shelf and give it to him  and did he\\r\\nask you for it  Why did he want it ”“Of course he asked for it ” said the wife very angrily  “and I just\\r\\ngave it him when I had drunk his health out of it  as he wished me to ”Then the potter was stricken with deadly fear  and remembered the words\\r\\nof the gipsy  “The first draught she will drink to your love  and the\\r\\nsecond draught she will drink to your hate ” and he knew in his heart\\r\\nthat the words were true  and that the cup carried with it a charm He sat and thought and thought  and waited many days  hoping that his\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 101 \\r\\n\\r\\nwife would change  and love him as before  but she remained cold and\\r\\nhard  Then the potter packed a wallet full of clothes  and put some\\r\\nmoney in his pocket  and he went to his wife and said  “Wife  there is\\r\\na man somewhere who has done me a great wrong  and perhaps he did it\\r\\nunwittingly  I am going out to find him  and to make him right it  and\\r\\nthough you do not love me  you will bide here quietly with your baby\\r\\ntill I come back  And I do not know if that will be in months or in\\r\\nyears ” Then the potter’s wife fell a crying  Pg 102 “I do not love you  nay  I hate you  and shall be glad when you have\\r\\ngone  but perhaps it may be because I am a wicked woman  and I do not\\r\\nknow what has come over me  that now I want to fly away from you  when\\r\\nI used to think that I had the best husband on all this earth ” The\\r\\npotter sighed bitterly  but he kissed her cheeks  which felt as cold as\\r\\nice  and then he said good bye to his baby  and started on his way with\\r\\nthe tears filling his eyes When the potter had gone the wife cried sorely  but still she was glad\\r\\nthat she had not to see him  and for some time she lived with her baby\\r\\nhappily enough  She kept the house  and mended and swept and cleaned as\\r\\nbefore  and thought little of the potter or where he had gone  but by\\r\\nand by all her money began to be spent  and she knew that unless the\\r\\npotter returned she would soon be very poor  and the winter was coming\\r\\non  and she feared cold and hunger for her little one  So she went into\\r\\na garret where she kept her old weaving loom  and she brought it out \\r\\nand she bought flax  and sat down to weave just as she used to  when\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 103 \\r\\n\\r\\nshe went round the country with her sister who spun the flax  And she\\r\\nfound that she could still weave her cloths very skilfully  and she\\r\\nbegan to sell them to the passers by  and in this way she earned her\\r\\nbread The winter set in very cold and hard  and the potter’s wife felt very\\r\\nsad  “But perhaps ” she said  “it is thinking of the poor things\\r\\nwho are starving around with no homes ” for she never thought of\\r\\nher husband at all  And the flax began to be very dear  and she had\\r\\ndifficulty in buying it  “Instead of doing all these cheap clothes ”\\r\\nshe said  “it would be better to get very fine flax  and do a very very\\r\\nfine cloth  it will be the finest cloth I have ever woven  and I will\\r\\nsell it to some very rich lady ” So she bought the finest flax that\\r\\nmoney could bring her  and when she had woven a little bit of it  she\\r\\nsat and looked at it in her room  and she saw a tress of her own golden\\r\\nhair lying upon it  and she thought how beautiful it looked  Then she\\r\\nsaid—“There is no one now who loves me or my hair  so I will weave it into\\r\\na cloth with this very fine flax  and I must sell it for a very large\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 104 \\r\\n\\r\\nsum of money  or else I shall have nothing left to go on with ” But\\r\\nshe couldn’t think of any pattern in which the hair looked well with\\r\\nthe fine linen flax  till at last she hit on one in which there was a\\r\\ncup with a heart on the top of it  The cup she made of the gold hair \\r\\nand the heart also  She worked at it for many long days  and when she\\r\\nhad finished it she looked at it  and was very much pleased  and said\\r\\nindeed it was the most beautiful cloth she had ever made  and now she\\r\\nmust make haste and take it in to the town and sell it for a great deal\\r\\nof money  or she and her child would begin to do badly for food and\\r\\nfire The snow was lying heavily upon the ground  as the potter’s wife stood\\r\\nby the window looking at her cloth  when there crawled up outside the\\r\\nwindow a poor gipsy woman leading a little boy by the hand  She had\\r\\nbig black eyes and a brown face  but her cheeks were so thin that the\\r\\ncolour scarcely showed in them  and the potter himself would have had\\r\\nmuch ado to recognize her as the gipsy girl who made the cup years\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 105 \\r\\n\\r\\nbefore  and her clothes all hung upon her in rags  and her little boy\\r\\nwas crying bitterly with the cold  She knocked against the window with\\r\\nher poor thin hands  “Take me in ” she cried  “and have pity on me \\r\\nfor I can go no further ” Then the potter’s wife opened the door  and\\r\\nthe gipsy woman entered the room with her little boy by her side  and\\r\\ncrouched by the fire “Where is the potter who lived here ” said the gipsy  “It is long years\\r\\nago since I saw him  and now I have come back to pray that he would\\r\\ngive me food  for I am starving ”“No ” said the wife  “I know not where he is  for he is my husband  and\\r\\nhe has left me  and right glad of it am I  but if you will stay here I\\r\\nwill give you food and drink and attend to you  for  poor woman  you\\r\\nseem to me to be very ill  so stay here and I will attend to you till\\r\\nyou are well enough to go your way ”“There is only one way that I shall ever go ” said the gipsy  and she\\r\\nlooked into the fire with her big black eyes  “and that is the road\\r\\nwhich leads to the churchyard  But if he was your husband  why do you\\r\\nsay that you are glad he is away  Is he not kind to you ” Pg 106 “He was very kind to me ” said the potter’s wife  “he gave me\\r\\neverything I wanted  and money and to spare  but for all that I could\\r\\nnot love him  and I am glad he has gone  and left me alone with my baby\\r\\ngirl ”“You are a foolish woman ” said the gipsy  “If you had a husband who\\r\\nloved you and worked for you well  you should have loved him and\\r\\ncherished him  My husband beat me  and was cruel to me  and stole all I\\r\\nhad  And now that I am dying  he has deserted me to die as I may ”Then the potter’s wife brought her food and bid her lie down  and dried\\r\\nher rags of clothes  and she wrapped the little boy in her own clothes \\r\\nand gave him food and put him to sleep  and as she lay  the gipsy woman\\r\\nwatched her with her great black eyes  and at last she said  “Have you\\r\\na brown cup here  a little rough brown cup  did your husband give it to\\r\\nyou ”The potter’s wife stared with astonishment  “How did you know I had a\\r\\nlittle rough brown cup ” she said  “There was such a one  and it stood\\r\\nupon the shelf  but I have given it away  I gave it to a poor gipsy man\\r\\nwho begged it of me  he wanted it so badly that I couldn’t refuse  and\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 107 \\r\\n\\r\\nhe made me drink his health in it ere he took it away ”Then the gipsy woman raised her head  and her eyes looked blacker and\\r\\nher cheeks blacker “And what was the gipsy man like ” she cried  “Had you drunk from the\\r\\ncup before  Can you remember ”“I remember well ” said the woman  “I drank from it on the day when I\\r\\npromised I would marry my husband  and I drank from it once again when\\r\\nI wished the gipsy God speed  and soon after that  my husband left me \\r\\nfor I could not bear to have him near me ”Then the gipsy cried out aloud  and said something in a language which\\r\\nthe woman did not understand  and beat her hands “I think it was my husband ” she said  “Alack a day  to morrow night\\r\\nI shall die  and who will take care of my little boy  and see that he\\r\\ndoes not starve  for his father would beat and ill treat him if he\\r\\nfound him ” Then the potter’s wife kneeled down beside the gipsy woman \\r\\nand kissed her on the forehead “Be at peace ” she said  “If it be that you must die  die with a\\r\\nquiet heart  for I will keep your little boy  What is enough for two\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 108 \\r\\n\\r\\nis enough for three  and he shall call my little girl sister and me\\r\\nmother ”The gipsy said nothing  but she looked at the potter’s wife for long \\r\\nand then she said  “And my clothes are all in rags  and I have no\\r\\ngarment in which you can wrap me for my grave ”Then the potter’s wife began to cry  “Be at peace ” she said  “for I\\r\\nhave a fine cloth made of flax and my own hair  and in it you can lie\\r\\nclad like a princess ”Then again the gipsy woman cried out words that the potter’s wife did\\r\\nnot understand  and again she beat her breast and lamented  But as\\r\\nevening drew nigh she turned to the potter’s wife  and told her all the\\r\\ntruth about the charms in the cup  and wept for the evil she had done\\r\\nher  who was so good and kind The potter’s wife sat by her all that day  and into the dark hours of\\r\\nthe night  but when it was drawing nigh to twelve o’clock the gipsy\\r\\nwoman sat up  and stretched out her arms  “The wheel ” she cried \\r\\n“bring me your husband’s wheel  and give me a piece of clay  that while\\r\\nthere is yet time I may throw my last cup  and you may drink from it\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 109 \\r\\n\\r\\nbefore the dawn and undo the harm I have worked ”The potter’s wife wondered much  but she feared to disobey her  and she\\r\\nwent out into her husband’s workshop  and she brought in his wheel and\\r\\na piece of clay which stood there  and placed them beside the gipsy \\r\\nThe gipsy was so weak that she could scarcely sit up  but when she saw\\r\\nthe wheel she staggered to her feet  and took the clay in her thin\\r\\nlittle brown hands  and moulded it as she had done years before  and\\r\\nthen she set it on the wheel  and set the wheel spinning  and formed it\\r\\ninto a little brown bowl  and bent her head over it  and whispered into\\r\\nit “Now drink ” she cried  “although the clay is still wet  Pour water\\r\\ninto it and drink from my little bowl  and wish me God speed as you did\\r\\nto my husband  And then dress me in white and gold like a princess  for\\r\\nI must start upon my journey  But keep my little boy always  and if my\\r\\nhusband comes to search for me  give him my ring  but tell him that he\\r\\nshall never find me more ”The potter’s wife poured some water into the little clay cup  and\\r\\nstooped her face and drank it  that the woman might be content  and\\r\\nwhen she had done so  the gipsy folded her hands and lay back and\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 110 \\r\\n\\r\\ndied  But when she had tasted the water out of the wet clay  the\\r\\npotter’s wife thought of her husband  and she called his name  and\\r\\ncried to him to come and help her with the poor gipsy woman  And then\\r\\nshe thought of how long it was since he had been with her  and she\\r\\nbegan to cry  and wept bitterly as she leant over the dead woman “Oh  where is he gone  why did I drive him from me ” she said  “Have\\r\\nI been mad  Truly the poor gipsy spoke rightly  that if a woman has a\\r\\nhusband who loves her and works for her  she should cherish him with\\r\\nall her might  Alas  alas  and now my husband is out in the wide world \\r\\nand I am alone here with no one to help me  until this poor woman told\\r\\nme  I never knew how wrong I was ” Then she looked at the gipsy woman\\r\\nlying in all her rags  and she remembered her promise to her  and she\\r\\ntook the fine linen cloth in which was woven the gold heart and the\\r\\ngilt cup  and she clothed her in it as if she were a princess  and the\\r\\nnext day the poor woman was buried  and no one knew from whence she\\r\\ncame nor to whom she belonged  Pg 111 Then the potter’s wife sat down  and grieved bitterly  for she didn’t\\r\\nknow what it would be best to do to find her husband again  and tell\\r\\nhim that she loved him as at first  At first she thought she would go\\r\\nout and seek for him in the wide  wide world  but then she remembered\\r\\nhow he bid her wait where she was till he came back  and she knew she\\r\\nought to do what he had told her  but as now she had three to keep\\r\\ninstead of two  she feared they would be very poor  and as she had\\r\\nburied the gipsy in the fine gold and white cloth woven with her hair \\r\\nshe had not got it to sell  and she had not any money left wherewith\\r\\nto buy more fine thread to weave  The gipsy’s little boy was a pretty\\r\\nboy  with dark eyes like his mother’s  and when she looked at him she\\r\\nsaid they would all three starve together  but she would keep him  as\\r\\nshe had promised his mother  rather than turn him out into the cold\\r\\nstreets  So she washed him  and mended his rags as best she might  and\\r\\nthen she began to seek everywhere for something she might weave to\\r\\nsell  and keep them from starving  She wandered round the garden  and\\r\\nin and out of the house  and the gipsy boy  who was a clever  bright\\r\\nlad  went with her  Pg 112 “What are you searching for ” he asked “I am searching for thread  that I may weave into some kind of cloth\\r\\nand sell ” she said  “Otherwise we shall surely starve  for I have no\\r\\nmoney left to buy it with  and nothing more left to sell ”“I will go and get you something to weave ” said the boy  and he ran\\r\\nout into the road  and looked up and down it to see what would come\\r\\npast  Presently there came up a big cart laden with straw  and on the\\r\\ntop of the cart lay one man  while another drove  The horses went\\r\\nslowly  and the gipsy boy followed them  and began to beg “Run off  little chap ” cried the man at the top  “I have no money to\\r\\ngive to beggars ”“But I don’t ask you for money ” cried the boy  “but of your charity\\r\\ngive me a handful of straw ”“And what do you want with a handful of straw ” asked the carter  as\\r\\nthe boy still went on begging “Why  see ” cried the lad  “I am all in rags  but if my mother had a\\r\\nhandful of straw she can weave me a coat  and I shall be quite warm ”\\r\\nat which the men both laughed  and declared that the idea of a coat\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 113 \\r\\n\\r\\nof straw was very funny  but the driver said  “Well  give some to the\\r\\nlittle chap  I expect he comes from a lot of lying gipsies further on \\r\\nand they want it for their animals  still it won’t do any harm to give\\r\\nhim a few wisps ” and so they flung down a bundle  and the boy picked\\r\\nit up  and ran back with it to the potter’s wife “See what I have brought you ” he cried  “Now make that into a mat  and\\r\\nI will take it out and sell it  and bring you back the money ”The potter’s wife was amazed by his cleverness  but she knew that the\\r\\ngipsies had to live by their wits  and that teaches them to be sharp \\r\\nso she sat down  and tried to weave the straw into a mat  as the gipsy\\r\\nboy had said At first she found it very hard to use  for it was coarse and brittle \\r\\nand she thought she could make nothing of it  The lad sat beside her \\r\\nand cut it into even lengths for her  and chose out the good pieces \\r\\nand at last betwixt them it was done  and it looked quite a smart\\r\\nlittle mat  and the boy took it on his back and ran away with it to the\\r\\nvillage  Pg 114 “A mat  a mat ” he cried  “who wants to buy a good straw mat to wipe\\r\\ntheir feet on when they are dirty  or for the cat to sit on by the\\r\\nfire  or to put over the fowl house and keep it warm ”At first all the people he met laughed at him  and said nobody wished\\r\\nto buy a mat at all  Then he turned into the ale house  There were\\r\\nsome men smoking and keeping themselves warm by the fire  and when the\\r\\nhost saw him  and the mat over his shoulder  he said it was quite a\\r\\nwell made thing  and he would have it to lay down by his doorway for\\r\\nin comers to tread on  and then one and another looked at it  and the\\r\\nboy told them where it came from  and said he could bring them plenty\\r\\nmore straw mats and carpets  all as good or better  and so well worked\\r\\nthat they would last almost for ever  and presently one and another\\r\\nbegan to say that they would buy them  and when he had taken his money \\r\\nthe gipsy boy ran home well content So the potter’s wife sat all day weaving straw mats  and presently she\\r\\ngot to do them so well  that from far and near the people sent to buy\\r\\nthem of her  Then after a time she put patterns into them  made with\\r\\nred  and black  and white straws  but do what she could  the patterns\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 115 \\r\\n\\r\\nalways came out in the shape of a cup  and still she wept and grieved\\r\\nall day long  Then the gipsy lad said to her—“What are you crying for now  You have plenty to eat and drink  Tell me\\r\\nwhy you are crying  and I will help you if I can  because you took my\\r\\nmother into your house to die  and buried her in your fine cloth like a\\r\\nprincess ”“I cry because my husband has gone a long way off ” said the potter’s\\r\\nwife  “and he doesn’t know that I love him  and he will never come back\\r\\nto me  for when he went away I hated him ”“He will never know it if you don’t try to tell him ” said the gipsy\\r\\nboy  “You should tell it to every one you meet  to all the birds of the\\r\\nair  and the wild animals too  That is what my mother told me to do \\r\\nif I wanted to send news abroad  You should say it even to the winds \\r\\nand write it in the sand  and on the earth  and on the leaves of the\\r\\ntrees in case they blow about  for she said all things could pass on a\\r\\nsecret  though none can keep one  And why don’t you weave it into your\\r\\nmats too  For the people who buy them take them far and near  and maybe\\r\\nhe will see one  and know that you want him to come home again ” Pg 116 Then the potter’s wife tried to weave her secret into her mats  and\\r\\nbeside the pattern of the cup she wove a little verse—“Now ” cried the gipsy boy  “your husband may see it  and perhaps he\\r\\nwill come home  and all will be well with us ”But still the potter journeyed far into the world  and wherever he went\\r\\nhe asked if any gipsy had been near there  and if there happened to be\\r\\na gipsy camp in the neighbourhood  he went to it at once  and asked\\r\\nfor a gipsy woman with red beads and gold chains in her hair  or for a\\r\\ngipsy man who carried a brown cup with him  But though he saw hundreds\\r\\nof gipsies  yet he never again saw the girl who had thrown the cup \\r\\nand none of the men knew anything about the man  nor could tell him\\r\\nanything about the little brown bowl  Then he went to the shops in the\\r\\nbig towns where jars and bowls are sold  and asked for a cup that had\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 117 \\r\\n\\r\\na spell in it  for he thought if they sold such a one  they might know\\r\\nhow to help him to undo the work of the gipsy’s bowl  but everywhere\\r\\nthe people only laughed at him So he went through strange countries  seeing strange things  but none\\r\\nof them gave him any pleasure  since he was always thinking of his wife\\r\\nat home  Then he returned to his native land  and pondered whether he\\r\\nshould go back to his own cottage  but his heart failed him  and he\\r\\nkept far from the little village where it stood “It would be little use to go home ” he said  “for if my wife is not\\r\\nglad to see me  it is no home to me  and she will not be glad to see me\\r\\ntill I can find the gipsy and know how the charm can be broken ”One night he went into a booth where there were a number of men\\r\\ndrinking  and amongst them there was one who looked like a gipsy  a\\r\\ndark  savage looking fellow who was talking loud  and boasting much\\r\\nof all he had done  The potter sat and listened to their talk  and\\r\\npresently they began quarrelling  and talking about who was the most\\r\\nbeautiful woman in the world  The gipsy cried out that he knew the\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 118 \\r\\n\\r\\nmost beautiful  and that she had given him a parting gift and wished\\r\\nhim God speed  and now he was going back to her  for he knew now the\\r\\nway to make her love him  and he meant to wed her and have her for his\\r\\nwife Upon this the others laughed and jeered  and said  was it likely that\\r\\nsuch a beautiful woman would care for such a rough  ill favoured fellow\\r\\nas he  and declared they didn’t think much of her beauty if she was\\r\\nwilling to marry him and to be his wife Then another man standing near said that he knew where lived the most\\r\\nbeautiful woman on the face of the earth  though he did not believe\\r\\nthat she would ever be wife of his  still all the same it would be hard\\r\\nto beat her for loveliness  and she was a clever worker too  for she it\\r\\nwas who worked the mats that lay under his feet in the cart he drove \\r\\nUpon this they all began to wrangle  and their words grew high “And if the beautiful woman loved you so ” cried one man to the gipsy \\r\\n“how could you come away and leave her ”The gipsy laughed  “She didn’t love me then ” he said  “but she will\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 119 \\r\\n\\r\\nnow  for I am taking her a charm which will make her love me more than\\r\\nany one on earth  She has only to drink out of the cup I carry here \\r\\nand she will be mine for life ”Upon this they all laughed  and derided him still more “Then let every one believe that what I say is true ” cried the gipsy \\r\\nand from his bosom he took out a small brown bowl and waved it in the\\r\\nair  “and here is the cup to prove it ” And the potter’s heart almost\\r\\nstood still  for he recognized the cup which the gipsy girl had made\\r\\nfor him years before The other man laughed scornfully  “That proves nothing ” he said  “I\\r\\nmight take the mat out from the cart and ask it to say if I spoke the\\r\\ntruth  but mats and cups have no tongues to speak with  though my mat\\r\\ncan say more than your cup  for there is a rhyme on it with a pattern\\r\\nof a cup  moreover  the rhyme is about a gipsy too ”“Let us see it ” cried they all Then the man went out to his cart and fetched in a white and brown\\r\\nstraw mat  covered with a pattern made of cups  and he read the rhyme\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 120 \\r\\n\\r\\nwhich was written upon it—On hearing this the potter jumped up  and dashed into their midst  and\\r\\nseized the cup “The gipsy speaks truth ” he cried  “when he says she is the most\\r\\nbeautiful woman in the world  but he speaks false when he says that she\\r\\nwill ever love him  for he has stolen that cup  and I shall take it\\r\\nfrom him  and if he tries to stop me  why then I will fight him  and\\r\\nlet every one see who is the better fellow of the two ”But when the gipsy had seen the rhyme upon the mat  he stood and stared\\r\\nas if he were made of stone  and said no word to the potter  and indeed\\r\\nscarcely seemed to notice that he had taken away the cup from him  Then\\r\\nthe potter turned to the man who owned the mat and said  “If you will\\r\\nsell me your mat I will pay you handsomely for it  and I beg you to\\r\\ntell me who made it  and where you got it  for I would like to buy some\\r\\nmore like it ” Pg 121 The traveller was much astonished  but he told the potter that it was\\r\\nmade by a woman who lived in a village a little way off  and she sat by\\r\\nher doorway and wove mats  with a gipsy boy to help her  and she was\\r\\nthe loveliest woman he had ever seen on earth  with eyes just like blue\\r\\ncornflowers and hair like golden corn  Then the potter took his bowl\\r\\nand the mat and started to go home  but the gipsy slunk out of the room\\r\\nand went into the night  and nobody noticed him Meantime the potter’s wife continued to grieve and lament  for in spite\\r\\nof her taking the gipsy boy’s advice  and telling all things that she\\r\\nloved her husband and wished him back  he did not come back to her  and\\r\\nthough she wove her rhyme into every mat that she made  she despaired\\r\\nof the potter’s ever seeing one  The only thing which seemed to console\\r\\nher  was the little brown clay cup that the gipsy woman had thrown for\\r\\nher  before she died  As it had never been baked in the oven  the clay\\r\\nwas dry and hard and cracked  and it was a sorry thing to look at  but\\r\\nstill the potter’s wife kept it beside her  and would drink out of\\r\\nnothing else  and from time to time she kissed it  and laid her cheek\\r\\nagainst it  Pg 122 The gipsy boy said to her—“If I were you I should watch for my husband all day  I would weave my\\r\\nmats in the doorway  and look up the road both ways  from morn till\\r\\nnight  otherwise your husband will come back and go past the cottage\\r\\nand you will never know ” So she took her loom and sat by the roadway \\r\\nand watched  and looked over the hill and to right and left for whoever\\r\\nmight come  And often the gipsy boy would watch too  and look from the\\r\\nother side of the cottage while the potter’s wife sat in the front  One\\r\\nday the gipsy boy ran round to her and said  “There is some one coming\\r\\nup the road who will come here  but it is not your husband  It is my\\r\\nfather  and he will want to take me away  and he will beat me as he did\\r\\nmy mother  And if he gets hold of the cup that my mother made for you \\r\\nhe knows all her charms  and he can undo what she did  and perhaps can\\r\\nthrow some evil spell on us all  so that your husband will never return\\r\\nagain  So the best thing will be for you to give me the cup and let me\\r\\nhide myself with it  and then you must tell him that you do not know\\r\\nwhere I am  and if he asks  tell him that the cup is gone  and when he\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 123 \\r\\n\\r\\nis gone I will come back again  but promise that you will not give me\\r\\nup to him ”So the potter’s wife promised that she would never give up the little\\r\\nboy  and she bid him take the cup and run quickly and hide himself  and\\r\\nthen she took her little girl by the hand and sat and waited for the\\r\\ngipsy man to come  though she trembled with fear  and wished him far\\r\\naway Presently the gipsy man came up to the front of the cottage where the\\r\\npotter’s wife sat  and bid her good day “I was here before ” he said  “And you gave me something to eat and\\r\\ndrink  Is your husband come back  for he was away then ”“My husband is away still ” she said  “But soon I hope he will be here ”Then the gipsy took up one of her mats which lay on the ground beside\\r\\nher  and looked at it “You are clever with your loom ” he said  “but what do you mean by the\\r\\nlittle verse you put on all these mats ”“It is a little verse which can but be rightly read by one person ”\\r\\nshe answered  “and if he sees it  it will not matter whether others\\r\\nunderstand it or no ” Pg 124 “And have you been here all alone since I came by ” asked the gipsy \\r\\n“have no other gipsies been past  for I want to join some of my own\\r\\npeople  and perhaps you can tell me which way they are gone ”“One came not so long ago ” answered the potter’s wife  “but she was\\r\\nso tired with tramping far that she could go no further  So she has\\r\\nstayed  and rests in the churchyard  She was a gipsy woman with red\\r\\nbeads and coins in her hair  And I kept her and let her die in peace \\r\\nand wrapped her in a cloth of white and gold ”“And did she do nothing while she rested here ” asked the gipsy man \\r\\n“Did she make you no present to pay you for your trouble ”“She made me a present which paid me for my trouble well ” said the\\r\\nwoman  “though it was only a little cup of clay that was grey and wet \\r\\nAnd she gave me this ring  and bid me give it to her husband if he came\\r\\nby here  and tell him that it was useless for him to seek her further ”The gipsy man looked at the ring she held out to him  and he turned\\r\\npale  and knit his brows “And where is that cup ” he asked  “and where is her little boy  For I\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 125 \\r\\n\\r\\nwill take him with me into the world ”“I don’t know where he is gone ” said the potter’s wife  “as for the\\r\\ncup  he took it with him when he went ”Meantime the gipsy boy had hidden in a hay stack quite close to the\\r\\ncottage  from where he could see the roadways all round  and he looked\\r\\nto right and left for who should pass  for he was still half afraid\\r\\nthat his father might come and search for him  and take him away by\\r\\nforce  As he lay and watched he saw a man coming over the hill  who\\r\\nlooked spent and tired  as if he had walked far  He seemed to know the\\r\\npath well  and he came straight to the cottage  but he did not come in \\r\\nbut waited near as if he wanted to see who was there  Then the gipsy\\r\\nboy said to himself—“Perhaps this is the potter himself  whom she has been looking for all\\r\\nthis time ” So he slid down and ran to the man and began to pretend to\\r\\nbeg The man looked at him and said—“You are a gipsy’s child  Where do you come from  Are you living under\\r\\na hedge  or do you come from a gipsy’s camp near ” Pg 126 “It is true I am a gipsy’s child ” answered the boy  “but I am living\\r\\nunder no hedge  but in that little cottage  for the woman who lives\\r\\nthere keeps me for love of my mother  who helped her when she was in\\r\\ntrouble ”“And what did your mother do for the woman ” asked the man  who was no\\r\\nother than the potter  “It must have been a great service  that she\\r\\nshould be willing to take you and keep you ”“She saved her from an evil charm that had been cast upon her ”\\r\\nanswered the boy  “and taught her to love her husband again  and she\\r\\nwaits his return now and longs for him to come  Therefore she promised\\r\\nto keep me with her  but now I dare not go into the cottage  because my\\r\\nfather  who is a gipsy  is there  and I am afraid lest he may take me\\r\\naway with him ”When the potter heard that the gipsy man was there he would have run\\r\\nstraight into the cottage  but the boy implored him to listen first\\r\\nand hear what he was saying  So they crept round to the side of the\\r\\ncottage  and they heard the gipsy man growing angry  and threatening\\r\\nthe potter’s wife  that if she did not tell him where his boy had gone\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 127 \\r\\n\\r\\nhe would seize her by the hair and wring her throat  in spite of her\\r\\nbeing so fair a woman  At this the potter waited no longer  but burst\\r\\ninto the cottage  and seized the gipsy and hurled him out of the house\\r\\nwith all his might  but he and his wife never looked to see if he was\\r\\nhurt or no  for they looked at nothing but each other and the little\\r\\nchild that the potter’s wife held by the hand  And the gipsy man went\\r\\naway  and they never heard of him again Then the potter’s wife showed her husband the gipsy boy  and told him\\r\\nof her promise to his mother  and of all he had done for her  and\\r\\nbegged him that he would let her keep him with them  And the potter\\r\\npromised that she should  and said that when he grew up to be a man he\\r\\nwould teach him his trade  and make him a potter like himself  So they\\r\\nall lived happily together  and the gipsy boy learned to make cups and\\r\\nbowls  and was very clever at doing them  but they were cups and bowls\\r\\nthat carried no charms with them  and so could do no one any harm that\\r\\ndrank from them  Pg 128 \\nOnce there lived\\r\\nan old gentleman who was a very rich old gentleman \\r\\nand able to buy nearly everything he wanted  He had earned all his\\r\\nwealth for himself by trading in a big city  and now he had grown so\\r\\nfond of money that he loved it better than anything else in the world \\r\\nand thought of nothing except how he could save it up and make more \\r\\nBut he never seemed to have time to enjoy himself with all that he had\\r\\nearned  and he was very angry if he was asked to give money to others \\r\\nHe lived in a handsome house all alone  and he had a very good cook who\\r\\ncooked him a sumptuous dinner every day  but he rarely asked any one\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 129 \\r\\n\\r\\nto share it with him  though he loved eating and drinking  and always\\r\\nhad the best of wine and food  His cook and his other servants knew\\r\\nthat he was greedy and hard  and cared for nobody  and though they\\r\\nserved him well because he paid them  they none of them loved him It was one Christmas  and the snow lay thick upon the ground  and the\\r\\nwind howled so fiercely that the old gentleman was very glad he was not\\r\\nobliged to go out into the street  but could sit in his comfortable\\r\\narm chair by the fire and keep warm “It really is terrible weather ” he said to himself  “terrible\\r\\nweather ” and he went to the window and looked out into the street \\r\\nwhere all the pavements were inches deep in snow  “I am very glad that\\r\\nI need not go out at all  but can sit here and keep warm for to day \\r\\nthat is the great thing  and I shall have some ado to keep out the cold\\r\\neven here with the fire ”He was leaving the window  when there came up in the street outside\\r\\nan old man  whose clothes hung in rags about him  and who looked half\\r\\nfrozen  He was about the same age as the old gentleman inside the\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 130 \\r\\n\\r\\nwindow  and the same height  and had grey  curly hair  like his  and\\r\\nif they had been dressed alike any one would have taken them for two\\r\\nbrothers “Oh  really ” said the old gentleman irritably  “this is most annoying \\r\\nThe parish ought to take up these sort of people  and prevent their\\r\\nwandering about the streets and molesting honest folk ” for the poor\\r\\nold man had taken off his hat  and began to beg “It is Christmas Day ” he said  and though he did not speak very loud \\r\\nthe old gentleman could hear every word he said quite plainly through\\r\\nthe window  “It is Christmas Day  and you will have your dinner here in\\r\\nyour warm room  Of your charity give me a silver shilling that I may go\\r\\ninto an eating shop  and have a dinner too ”“A silver shilling ” cried the old gentleman  “I never heard of such a\\r\\nthing  Monstrous  Go away  I never give to beggars  and you must have\\r\\ndone something very wicked to become so poor ”But still the old man stood there  though the snow was falling on his\\r\\nshoulders  and on his bare head  “Then give me a copper ” he said \\r\\n“just one penny  that to day I may not starve ” Pg 131 “Certainly not ” cried the old gentleman  “I tell you I never give to\\r\\nbeggars at all ” But the old man did not move “Then ” he said  “give me some of the broken victuals from your table \\r\\nthat I may creep into a doorway and eat a Christmas dinner there ”“I will give you nothing ” cried the old gentleman  stamping his foot \\r\\n“Go away  Go away at once  or I shall send for the policeman to take\\r\\nyou away ”The old beggar man put on his hat and turned quietly away  but what\\r\\nthe old gentleman thought was very odd was  that instead of seeming\\r\\ndistressed he was laughing merrily  and then he looked back at the\\r\\nwindow  and called out some words  but they were in a foreign tongue \\r\\nand the old gentleman could not understand them  So he returned to his\\r\\ncomfortable arm chair by the fire  still murmuring angrily that beggars\\r\\nought not to be allowed to be in the streets Next morning the snow fell more thickly than ever  and the streets were\\r\\nalmost impassable  but it did not trouble the old gentleman  for he\\r\\nknew he need not go out and get wet or cold  But in the morning when he\\r\\ncame down to breakfast  to his great surprise there was a cat on the\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 132 \\r\\n\\r\\nhearthrug in front of the fire  looking into it  and blinking lazily \\r\\nNow the old gentleman had never had any animal in his house before \\r\\nand he at once went to it and said “Shoo shoo ” and tried to turn it\\r\\nout  But the cat did not move  and when the old gentleman looked at it\\r\\nnearer  he could not help admiring it very much  It was a very large\\r\\ncat  grey and black  and had extremely long soft hair  and a thick soft\\r\\nruff round its neck  Moreover  it looked very well fed and cared for \\r\\nand as if it had always lived in comfortable places  Somehow it seemed\\r\\nto the old gentleman to suit the room and the rug and the fire  and to\\r\\nmake the whole place look more prosperous and cosy even than it had\\r\\ndone before “A fine creature  a very handsome cat ” he said to himself  “I should\\r\\nreally think that a reward would be offered for such an animal  as it\\r\\nhas evidently been well looked after and fed  so it would be a pity to\\r\\nturn it away in a hurry ”One thing struck him as very funny about the cat  and that was that\\r\\nthough the ground was deep in snow and slush outside  the cat was quite\\r\\ndry  and its fur looked as if it had just been combed and brushed \\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 133 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe old gentleman called to his cook and asked if she knew how the cat\\r\\nhad come in  but she declared she had not seen it before  and said\\r\\nshe believed it must have come down the chimney as all the doors and\\r\\nwindows had been shut and bolted  However  there it was  and when his\\r\\nown breakfast was finished the old gentleman gave it a large saucer of\\r\\nmilk  which it lapped up not greedily or in a hurry  but as if it were\\r\\nquite used to good food and had had plenty of it always “It really is a very handsome animal  and most uncommon ” said the\\r\\nold gentleman  “I shall keep it awhile and look out for the reward ”\\r\\nbut though he looked at all the notices in the street and in the\\r\\nnewspapers  the old gentleman could see no notice about a reward being\\r\\noffered for a grey and black cat  so it stayed on with him from day to\\r\\nday Every day the cat seemed to his master to grow handsomer and handsomer \\r\\nThe old gentleman never loved anything but himself  but he began to\\r\\ntake a sort of interest in the strange cat  and to wonder what sort\\r\\nit was—if it was a Persian or a Siamese  or some curious new sort of\\r\\nwhich he had never heard  He liked the sound of its lazy contented\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 134 \\r\\n\\r\\npurring after its food  which seemed to speak of nothing but comfort\\r\\nand affluence  So the cat remained on till nearly a year had passed\\r\\naway It was not very long before Christmas that an acquaintance of the old\\r\\ngentleman’s came to his rooms on business  He knew a great deal about\\r\\nall sorts of animals and loved them for their own sakes  but of course\\r\\nhe had never talked to the old gentleman about them  because he knew he\\r\\ndid not love anything  But when he saw the grey cat  he said at once—“Do you know that this is a very valuable creature  and I should think\\r\\nwould be worth a great deal ”At these words the old gentleman’s heart beat high  Here  he thought \\r\\nwould be a piece of great luck if a stray cat could make him richer\\r\\nthan he was before “Why  who would want to buy it ” he said  “I don’t know anybody who\\r\\nwould be so foolish as to give any money for a cat which is of no\\r\\nuse in life except to catch mice  when you can so easily get one for\\r\\nnothing ” Pg 135 “Ah  but many people are very fond of cats  and would give much for\\r\\nrare sorts like this  If you want to sell it  the right thing would\\r\\nbe to send it to the Cat Show  and there you would most likely take a\\r\\nprize for it  and then some one would be sure to buy it  and  it may\\r\\nbe  would give a great deal  I don’t know what kind it is  or where it\\r\\ncomes from  for I have never seen one the least like it  but for that\\r\\nreason it is very sure to be valuable ”Upon this the old gentleman almost laughed with joy “Where is the Cat Show ” he asked  “and when is it to be held ”“There will be a Cat Show in this city quite soon ” said his\\r\\nacquaintance  “and it will be a particularly good one  for the new\\r\\nPrincess is quite crazy about cats  and she is coming to it  and it is\\r\\nsaid that she doesn’t mind what she gives for a cat if she sees one she\\r\\nlikes ”So then he told the old gentleman how he should send his name and the\\r\\ncat’s name to the people who managed the show  and where it was to be\\r\\nheld  and went away  leaving the old gentleman well pleased  but to\\r\\nhimself he laughed and said  “I don’t think that old man thinks of\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 136 \\r\\n\\r\\nanything on earth but making money  How pleased he was at the idea of\\r\\nselling that beautiful cat if he could get something for it ”When he had gone  the grey puss came and rubbed itself about his\\r\\nmaster’s legs  and looked up in his face as though it had understood\\r\\nthe conversation  and did not like the idea of being sent to the show \\r\\nBut the old gentleman was delighted  and sat by the fire and mused on\\r\\nwhat he was likely to get for the cat  and wondered if it would not\\r\\ntake a prize “I shall be sorry to have to send it away ” he said  “still  if I could\\r\\nget a good round sum of money it would be a real sin not to take it  so\\r\\nyou will have to go  puss  and it really was extraordinary good luck\\r\\nfor me that you ever came here ”The days passed  and Christmas Day came  and again the snow fell  and\\r\\nthe ground was white  The wind whistled and blew  and on Christmas\\r\\nmorning the old gentleman stood and looked out of the window at the\\r\\nfalling snow and rain  and the grey cat stood beside him  and rubbed\\r\\nitself against his hand  He rather liked stroking it  it was so soft\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 137 \\r\\n\\r\\nand comfortable  and when he touched the long hair he always thought of\\r\\nhow much money he should get for it This morning he saw no old beggar man outside the window  and he said\\r\\nto himself  “I really think they manage better with the beggars than\\r\\nthey used to  and are clearing them from the town ”But just as he was leaving the window he heard something scratching\\r\\noutside  and there crawled on to the window sill another cat  It was\\r\\na very different creature to the grey cat on the rug  It was a poor \\r\\nthin  wretched looking animal  with ribs sticking through its fur  and\\r\\nit mewed in the most pathetic manner  and beat itself against the pane \\r\\nWhen it saw it  the handsome grey puss was very much excited  and ran\\r\\nto and fro  and purred loudly “Oh you disgraceful looking beast ” said the old gentleman angrily \\r\\n“go away  this is not the place for an animal like you  There is\\r\\nnothing here for stray cats  And you look as if you had not eaten\\r\\nanything for months  How different to my puss here ” and he tapped\\r\\nagainst the window to drive it away  But still it would not go  and\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 138 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe old gentleman felt very indignant  for the sound of its mewing was\\r\\nterrible  So he opened the window  and though he did not like to touch\\r\\nthe miserable animal  he took it up and hurled it away into the snow \\r\\nand it trotted away  and in the deep snow he could not see the way it\\r\\nwent But that evening  after he had had his Christmas dinner  as he sat by\\r\\nthe fire with the grey puss on the hearthrug beside him  he heard again\\r\\nthe noise outside the window  and then he heard the stray cat crying\\r\\nand mewing to be let in  and again the grey and black cat became very\\r\\nmuch excited  and dashed about the room  and jumped at the window as if\\r\\nit wanted to open it “I shall really be quite glad when I have sold you at the Cat Show ”\\r\\nsaid the old gentleman  “if I am going to have all sorts of stray cats\\r\\nworrying here ” and for the second time he opened the window  and\\r\\nseized the trembling  half starved creature  and this time he threw\\r\\nit with all his might as hard as he could throw  “And now there is an\\r\\nend of you  I hope ” he said as he heard it fall with a dull thud  and\\r\\nsettled himself again in his arm chair  and the grey puss returned to\\r\\nthe hearthrug  but it did not purr or rub itself against its master  Pg 139 Next morning when he came down to breakfast  the old gentleman poured\\r\\nout a saucer of milk for his cat as usual  “You must be well fed if you\\r\\nare going to be shown at the show ” he said  “and I must not mind a\\r\\nlittle extra expense to make you look well  It will all be paid back \\r\\nso this morning you shall have some fish as well as your milk ” Then he\\r\\nput the saucer of milk down by the cat  but it never touched it  but\\r\\nsat and looked at the fire with its tail curled round it “Oh  well  if you have had so much already that you don’t want it  you\\r\\ncan take it when you do ” so he went away to his work and left the\\r\\nsaucer of milk by the fire  But when he came back in the evening there\\r\\nwas the saucer of milk and the piece of fish  and the grey cat had not\\r\\ntouched them  “This is rather odd ” said the old gentleman  “however  I\\r\\nsuppose cook has been feeding you ”Next morning it was just the same  When he poured out the milk the cat\\r\\nwouldn’t lap it  but sat and looked at the fire  The old gentleman felt\\r\\na little anxious  for he fancied that the animal’s fur did not look\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nso bright as usual  and when in the evening and the next day and the\\r\\nnext  it would not lap its milk  or even smell the nice pieces of fish\\r\\nhe gave it  he was really uncomfortable  “The creature is getting ill ”\\r\\nhe said  “and this is most provoking  What will be the use of my having\\r\\nkept it for a year  if now I cannot show it ” He scolded his cook\\r\\nfor having given it unwholesome food  but the cook swore it had had\\r\\nnothing  Anyhow it was growing terribly thin  and all day long it sat\\r\\nin front of the fire with its tail hanging down  not curled up neatly\\r\\nround it  and its coat looked dull and began to come out in big tufts\\r\\nof hair “Now really I shall have to do something ” said the old gentleman \\r\\n“it is enough to make any one angry  No one would believe that this\\r\\ncould be a prize cat  It looks almost as wretched as that stray beast\\r\\nthat came to the window on Christmas Day ” So he went to a cat and\\r\\ndog doctor  who lived near  and asked him to come in and see a very\\r\\nbeautiful cat which had nothing the matter with it  but which refused\\r\\nto eat its food  The cat’s doctor came and looked at the cat  and then\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 141 \\r\\n\\r\\nlooked very grave  and shook his head  and looked at it again “I don’t know what sort of cat it is ” he said  “for I never saw any\\r\\nother like it  but it is a very handsome beast  and must be very\\r\\nvaluable  Well  I will leave you some physic for it  and I hope you may\\r\\nbe able to pull it round  but with these foreign cats you never know\\r\\nwhat ails them  and they are hard to cure ”Now the day was close at hand when the cat should have been sent to the\\r\\nshow  and the old gentleman was getting more and more uneasy  for the\\r\\ngrey cat lay upon the rug all day and never moved  and its ribs could\\r\\nalmost be seen through its side  so thin had it grown  And oddly enough\\r\\nthe old gentleman  who had never cared for any one or anything in his\\r\\nlife except himself  began to feel very unhappy  not only because of\\r\\nnot getting the money  but because he did not like to think of losing\\r\\nthe cat itself  He sent for his friend who had first told him about the\\r\\nCat Show  and asked his advice  but his friend could not tell him what\\r\\nto do with it “Well  well ” he said  “this is a bad business  for I have told every\\r\\none that you are going to exhibit a most extraordinarily beautiful\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 142 \\r\\n\\r\\ncat  and now this poor creature is really fit for nothing but the\\r\\nknacker’s yard  I think  maybe  some naturalist would give you a good\\r\\nprice for its skin  as it is so very uncommon  and if I were you I\\r\\nshould kill it at once  for if it dies a natural death its skin won’t\\r\\nbe worth a brass farthing ” At these words the grey cat lifted its\\r\\nhead  and looked straight into the old gentleman’s face  as if it\\r\\ncould understand  and for the first time for many a long year  the old\\r\\ngentleman felt a feeling of pity in his heart  and was angry with his\\r\\nfriend for his suggestion “I won’t have it killed ” he cried  “why  I declare  though it does\\r\\nseem absurd  I have lived with this creature for a year  and I feel as\\r\\nif it were my friend  and if it would only get well and sit up on the\\r\\nhearthrug  I shouldn’t mind about the money one bit ”At this his friend was greatly astonished  and went away wondering \\r\\nwhile the old gentleman sat by the fire and watched the cat lying\\r\\npanting on the rug “Poor pussy  poor old pussy ” he said  “it is a pity that you can’t\\r\\nspeak and tell me what you want  I am sure I would give it to you ”\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 143 \\r\\n\\r\\nJust as he spoke there came a noise outside  and he heard a mewing  and\\r\\nlooking through the window he saw the same thin ugly brown cat that\\r\\nhad come there last Christmas  and it looked as thin and wretched as\\r\\never  When she heard the sound the grey cat stood up on her tottering\\r\\nfeet and tried to walk to the window  This time the old gentleman did\\r\\nnot drive it away  but looked at it  and almost felt sorry for it  it\\r\\nlooked almost as thin and ill as his own grey puss “You are an ugly brute ” he said  “and I don’t want you always hanging\\r\\nabout  still  maybe you would be none the worse for a little milk now \\r\\nand it might make you look better ” So he opened the window a little \\r\\nand then he shut it and then he opened it again  and this time the\\r\\nbrown cat crawled into the room  and went straight to the hearthrug to\\r\\nthe grey puss  There was a big saucer of milk on the hearthrug  and the\\r\\nbrown cat began to lap it at once  and the old gentleman never stopped\\r\\nit He thought as he watched it  that it grew fatter under his eyes as it\\r\\ndrank  and when the saucer was empty he took a jug and gave it some\\r\\nmore  “I really am an old fool ” he said  “that is a whole pennorth\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 144 \\r\\n\\r\\nof milk ” No sooner had he poured out the fresh milk than the grey\\r\\ncat raised itself  and sitting down by the saucer began to lap it as\\r\\nwell  as if it were quite well  The old gentleman stared with surprise \\r\\n“Well  this is the queerest thing ” he said  So he took some fish and\\r\\ngave it to the strange cat  and then  when he offered some to his own\\r\\npuss  it ate it as if there was nothing the matter  “This is most\\r\\nremarkable ” said the old gentleman  “perhaps it was the company of a\\r\\ncreature of its own sort that my cat needed  after all ” And the grey\\r\\ncat purred and began to rub itself against his legs So for the next few days the two cats lay together on the hearthrug \\r\\nand though it was too late to send the grey cat to the show  the old\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 145 \\r\\n\\r\\ngentleman never thought about it  so pleased was he that it had got\\r\\nwell again But seven nights after the stray cat had come in from outside  as the\\r\\nold gentleman lay asleep in bed at night  he felt something rub itself\\r\\nagainst his face  and heard his cat purring softly  as though it wanted\\r\\nto say “good bye ” “Be quiet  puss  and lie still till the morning ” he\\r\\nsaid  But when he came down to have his breakfast in the morning  there\\r\\nsat the brown tabby  looking fat and comfortable by the fire  but the\\r\\ngrey cat was not there  and though they looked for it everywhere  no\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 146 \\r\\n\\r\\none could find it  though all the windows and doors had been shut  so\\r\\nthey could not think how it could have got away  The old gentleman was\\r\\nvery unhappy about it  but he looked at the strange cat on his hearth\\r\\nand said  “it would be unkind now to send this poor thing away  so it\\r\\nmay as well stay here ”When she heard him speaking of its being unkind  his old cook burst out\\r\\nlaughing  “Perhaps ” she said  “’twas a fairy cat  as it could get away\\r\\nthrough bolts and locks  and nothing but a fairy could have taught my\\r\\nmaster to think of a thing being unkind or not  I only hope that now\\r\\nhe’ll think of some one in this world besides himself and his money ”\\r\\nAnd sure enough from that time the old gentleman began to forget about\\r\\nhis money  and to care for the people about him  and it was all the\\r\\ndoing of the strange cat who had come from no one knew where  and gone\\r\\naway to no one knew where  Pg 147 \\nOnce upon a time there was a village on the top of a mountain  where\\r\\nduring the winter months the villagers saw no one but each other  for\\r\\nthe mountain was so steep and the path so narrow that  when it was\\r\\nblocked with ice  it was dangerous to ascend  so during the winter\\r\\nmonths the people lived by themselves  and cheered themselves as\\r\\nthey might in the long dreary evenings  with games and dancing and\\r\\nsinging and playing on pipes  for they were cheerful folk  joyous and\\r\\nlight hearted  The sweetest singer in the village was a lad named\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 148 \\r\\n\\r\\nOthmar  his voice was as sweet as a nightingale’s before the dawn \\r\\nand also he was the handsomest young fellow in all the country round \\r\\nStrangers turned to look after him as he went by  he was tall and\\r\\nstraight  and had curly brown hair  and big brown eyes  and lips that\\r\\nalways smiled  He lived with his old mother  who was a widow  and he\\r\\nworked for them both in the fields and on the farms  When he was a\\r\\nboy he learned the notes of all the birds  and could imitate them so\\r\\nexactly that they would fly down to him and settle on his shoulders \\r\\nWhen the farmers had sown their fields  and the birds would have come\\r\\nto pick up the grain  they sent for Othmar  and he sang and whistled\\r\\ntill they all left the field and flew after him  So often he was called\\r\\nthe bird boy One evening before the winter had set in  or the roads were blocked\\r\\nwith ice  there came along the high road into the village  a dwarf in\\r\\na yellow cap leading a donkey  on whose back were fastened numberless\\r\\nmusical instruments  Fiddles of all sorts  and viols  horns  trumpets \\r\\nand pipes  and a big drum  and a small one with triangles and cymbals \\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 149 \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the village the little man stopped and looked about\\r\\nhim  “Who would like to hear my music ” he cried  and then as the\\r\\nvillagers came crowding around him  he bade them all sit down while he\\r\\nunpacked his mule  but he forbade any of them to help him  or to touch\\r\\none of the instruments  “For mine is no common music ” he quoth  “all\\r\\nthese I have made myself  and in each is a machine which makes it go on\\r\\nplaying by itself  if once I start it  See here ” and he took up a long\\r\\npipe and began to blow  and there came forth the sweetest notes that\\r\\nhad ever been heard from any pipe  The little man paused for a minute \\r\\nwith the pipe in his hand  and then laid it down on the ground  when \\r\\nwonderful to relate  it went on playing of itself All the villagers stared with surprise  and some called out that it\\r\\nwas magic  and crossed themselves  but the little man took up another\\r\\npipe  and set that going too  and then the horns and the trumpets  and\\r\\nthe drums and the cymbals  and then he took a fiddle and drew the bow\\r\\nacross it  and how it played  It made the people weep and laugh  Othmar\\r\\nlay on the ground listening  and it seemed to him as if the sound were\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 150 \\r\\n\\r\\nmade of silver  and when the musician had started them  and all the\\r\\nother fiddles were playing together  he felt as if he should go mad for\\r\\njoy to hear anything so lovely Just behind where Othmar lay sat a young girl  named Hulda  She was\\r\\nan orphan  and dwelt alone with an old woman  who gave her food and\\r\\nlodging for sweeping out her room  and cleaning and cooking  Also Hulda\\r\\nmade money for her by going out to work for the other women in the\\r\\nvillage  She was neither pretty nor clever  but she was a good girl \\r\\nand if any of the villagers were ill or in trouble  it was for Hulda\\r\\nthey would send at once  because they knew she would spare no pains to\\r\\nhelp them  and would think nothing too much trouble  She had played\\r\\nwith Othmar ever since they were babies  and loved him dearly  She was\\r\\nthe only one who listened to the music who did not think it beautiful \\r\\nShe shuddered as she heard it  and she sat and watched Othmar and saw\\r\\nthat there were tears in his eyes  and she grieved that she did not\\r\\nlove it as he did When at last the instruments stopped and the listeners began to feel\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 151 \\r\\n\\r\\nfor money for the musician  he laughed and said  “You need not give me\\r\\nmoney  for I am very rich  and don’t need it  In return for my playing \\r\\nI only ask for one recompense  Let any of your young folks who sing \\r\\nsing me a song  for I too love hearing music that is not my own ” On\\r\\nthis the villagers began to look round for all who could sing  and they\\r\\nchose out some three or four  and begged them to sing their very best\\r\\nto the wonderful musician  Among them was Othmar  but they all bid him\\r\\nwait to the last  as his would be the best  Whilst the others were\\r\\nsinging  the little man did not seem to heed them much  though they\\r\\ntried hard to sing well  and chose their prettiest songs  but their\\r\\nvoices sounded very rough and poor after the playing But when Othmar began he stopped twanging the fiddle strings and\\r\\nwatched him  Othmar’s voice rang out clear and sweet  and all the\\r\\nvillage folk felt proud of his singing  even after hearing the\\r\\nwonderful instruments  When he ceased the little man rose  and said—“You have a sweet voice  my boy  be sure that you always use it well \\r\\nand now I must be going my way  but as I am a stranger here  perhaps\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 152 \\r\\n\\r\\nyou would not mind setting me on my road  and showing me the best way\\r\\nover the hill ”Othmar sprang up  delighted to go with him  but Hulda  who watched from\\r\\nbehind  came up to him and whispered—“Oh  Othmar  don’t let him take you far—come back soon ”“How silly you are  Hulda ” said Othmar  almost angrily  “Of course I\\r\\nshall come back  but I shall go with him as far as he wants  and then \\r\\nperhaps  he will let me hear him play again ”Othmar and the little dwarf started with the mule laden with\\r\\ninstruments  and Othmar led the way down the best road  The dwarf did\\r\\nnot speak at all  and so they went on in silence till they had got on\\r\\nto the top of a high hill where they could see the country all round\\r\\nfor miles  and the moon was beginning to rise  Here the musician\\r\\nstopped his mule  and stood for a while looking all round  Then he\\r\\nturned  and said to Othmar—“I know now where I am  and here will I\\r\\nstay for to night  but first before you leave me  would you not like to\\r\\nhear my fiddles and horns again ” Pg 153 “That I would ” cried Othmar  and he sat himself down on the ground\\r\\ndelighted  while the little man unloaded the mule “And now ” he said to Othmar with a twisted smile  “you shall hear them\\r\\nplay as no one has ever heard them  Yes  and you shall see them too ”\\r\\nthen he laid them in rows—the fiddles first  and the viols  and then\\r\\nthe horns and trumpets  and last the drums and cymbals and triangles \\r\\nand clapped his hands  giving a long  shrill whistle  As he whistled \\r\\nthe instruments rose from the ground  and they began to swell  and\\r\\ntheir shapes to change till no longer did they look like musical\\r\\ninstruments  but like human beings  only each had in a strange way kept\\r\\nthe shape it had formerly  The flutes and pipes were tall and thin \\r\\nand they and the violins had changed into beautiful girls with slender\\r\\nthroats  and the trumpets were all men and boys of different sizes  but\\r\\nthe drum was the strangest of all  for it was a fat man with very short\\r\\nlegs  The moon had risen and Othmar could see them all quite clearly \\r\\nand though he trembled with fear and his heart beat high  yet still\\r\\nhe watched  They stood silent together for a space in a weird crowd \\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 154 \\r\\n\\r\\nand then the dwarf waved his arms and called  “Ay  are you all there \\r\\nmy children —yes  one  two three four five  six seven eight  nine\\r\\nten eleven twelve  thirteen—that is right  Come practice  practice \\r\\npractice  and then you shall have a game  and see who Othmar loves\\r\\nbest  and who he will kiss first ”Then they all began to sing together  but each voice was like the sound\\r\\nof its own instrument  only it said words through its tones  and in\\r\\nOthmar’s ears their music sounded as never music had sounded before \\r\\nThe voices of the violin girls were so sweet that he felt as if he must\\r\\nweep to hear them  while the sound of the pipes and trumpets filled him\\r\\nwith longing to go into the world and fight and win battles  He sat on\\r\\nthe ground and listened to them like one in a trance  and he felt as if\\r\\nhe never wished to rise or go away again  The dwarf sat on a hillock\\r\\nnear  and did not seem to heed them much  When Othmar took his eyes\\r\\nfrom the dancers for a minute  he found that the place was quite full\\r\\nof all the animals who are never seen by day  but who fly out by night \\r\\nThere were crowds of bats and owls  and odd moths  all poised in the\\r\\nair  and seeming to watch the musicians and listen to their singing \\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 155 \\r\\n\\r\\nThen when he looked on the ground  he saw that strange wood snakes and\\r\\ntoads had come out boldly  and with their heads turned towards the\\r\\ndancers remained motionless and watched them  whilst near him green and\\r\\nbrown lizards lay still as stone  with heads on one side  all staring\\r\\nthrough the dusky night at the singers  Othmar thought he only had\\r\\nwatched them for a few minutes  when suddenly the dwarf cried out—“The\\r\\ndawn  the dawn  my children  see  there is red in the sky  Come  be\\r\\nquick  see who will win Othmar’s gift before we go on our way ” When\\r\\nhe was silent all the singing girls approached Othmar  but before the\\r\\nothers came one who looked slighter and younger  and whose voice though\\r\\nas sweet was weaker “See  Othmar ” she cried  “before we go on and leave you  let us try to\\r\\nsing one song together  Sing you as I do ” And Othmar sang with her as\\r\\nshe sang  in a clear voice like a bird’s— Pg 156 And then ere the last notes had left Othmar’s mouth  she bent forward \\r\\nand clasped him in her slender arms  and kissed him on the lips while\\r\\nstill they were open to sing “Good bye  Othmar ” cried she  “and that will be your last note for\\r\\nmany a long year  for surely you will have no need to sing after I am\\r\\ngone ” and at that all the strange folk standing near gave a laugh\\r\\nthat was more a chord of music than a laugh  And when her lips touched\\r\\nOthmar’s he quivered all over as a fiddle string does when the bow is\\r\\ndrawn across it  and he gave a cry which was like the sweet sound of a\\r\\nbell “Mine  mine ” cried the girl  as he fell back from her frightened  “Now\\r\\nmy voice will be the sweetest and best of all  for I have got Othmar’s\\r\\ntoo  No one will hear Othmar now —Othmar who sang like the birds  And\\r\\nnever will he call the birds again  but I can sing as he sang  and all\\r\\nwho hear me will think that Othmar sings too  Rejoice  my sisters  sing\\r\\nand rejoice ” but at that moment the dwarf started up crying out— Pg 157 8  Pg 159 “The dawn  the dawn  my children  see  the sun  the sun  beware  beware\\r\\nits rays ” Then came a great burst of sound like a chord from all the\\r\\nmusic folk  followed by a flash of light like lightning  and when it\\r\\nhad cleared away  the singing men and girls had gone  and in their\\r\\nplaces there lay upon the ground all the musical instruments—fiddles \\r\\nviols  pipes  horns  and cymbals  Othmar stood staring as if he had\\r\\nbeen turned to stone  and watched as if he were in a dream  while the\\r\\nlittle man quietly packed the instruments on to the mule  and went away\\r\\nleading it by the bridle as he had come “Good bye  Othmar ” he called back  “good bye  When you hear my fiddles\\r\\nagain  they will be sweeter than ever  for I have added your voice to\\r\\nthem ” And he went on his way over the hillside and disappeared beyond\\r\\nthe ridge  Othmar ran after him  but he stumbled and fell  He tried to\\r\\ncall out  but no voice would come  Tears ran down his cheeks  and he\\r\\nsobbed bitterly  but no sound came with the sobs  and he knew that his\\r\\nvoice had left him  The singing girl had stolen it  and he could never\\r\\nsing or cry out again The sun was rising high in the heavens  The green lizards  slow worms \\r\\nfrogs and beetles were still ranged around  and gazed at Othmar with\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 160 \\r\\n\\r\\ntheir heads wonderingly on one side  The birds sang louder and louder \\r\\nand their voices sounded sweet in the morning air  Othmar bent his head\\r\\nand wept because he knew that never could he call them to him again \\r\\nThen from behind a bush there rose a big black raven  who cast a long\\r\\nshadow behind him which almost covered Othmar as he sat  and it gave a\\r\\ndeep croak and then spoke quite clearly—“Poor Othmar ” it said  “she has stolen your voice ” and he hopped\\r\\ndown  “You will never speak nor sing again  Poor Othmar —ah  they\\r\\nstole my voice too  once I could sing far better than the birds you\\r\\nhear now  That was thousands of years ago  but the dwarf came to my\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 161 \\r\\n\\r\\nnest  and told me if I would go with him he would teach me how to\\r\\nwhistle so that the worms should rise out of the ground and jump into\\r\\nmy mouth when they heard me  and he called one of his trumpet men\\r\\nto teach me—one you saw dance—and he bid me lay my beak below his\\r\\nlips while he sang  then he stole my voice  all but a croak  which he\\r\\ndid not want because it was so harsh  but all your voice was sweet \\r\\ntherefore she has got it all—poor Othmar  poor Othmar ”Then Othmar raised himself  with the tears running from his eyes  and\\r\\nturned to find his way back to the village  It seemed a long distance \\r\\nfor he missed his path  and it was near nightfall before he saw the\\r\\ntops of the cottages and his own little home  but as he neared the\\r\\nvillage  he could see Hulda standing in the road  shading her eyes from\\r\\nthe sun  and watching the way he came “Othmar ” she cried when she saw him  “is it you  I have been to search\\r\\nfor you far and near  and there are others now looking for you  for we\\r\\nwere afraid lest you had fallen down some crevice  or slipped over the\\r\\nrocks ”Othmar came up to her  and put out his hand  and she saw how pale he\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 162 \\r\\n\\r\\nwas  and that his eyes were full of tears  but he said nothing “Othmar  tell me ” cried Hulda  “what has happened  why don’t you\\r\\nspeak ” but still Othmar was silent  “Are you hurt  Othmar  Did the\\r\\ndwarf do you any harm ”Then Othmar flung himself on the ground  and began to sob  but his sobs\\r\\ngave no sound  though the ground was wet with his tears  and Hulda knew\\r\\nthat Othmar was dumb “Poor Othmar  poor Othmar ” croaked the raven who had kept close to\\r\\nOthmar  and flew overhead  but Hulda did not understand it  only she\\r\\nwept to see his grief “Never fear  Othmar ” she said tenderly  “your voice will soon come\\r\\nback  it was the long cold night  and the fear that has driven it away \\r\\nCome home with me  and let me nurse you  and you shall soon be well ”Othmar shook his head  and the tears fell from his eyes  but he let her\\r\\ntake his hand and lead him into the village where his old mother sat\\r\\nand waited for him  but still  although she sprang forward to greet\\r\\nhim  and put her arms around his neck  he could not speak  and his deep\\r\\nsobs gave no sound  At first the villagers said he was ill  and soon\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 163 \\r\\n\\r\\nhe would be well again  but as the days passed and he never spoke  they\\r\\nknew that he was struck dumb  Some said it was the cold  and some that\\r\\nhe had been frightened  only Hulda said to herself  “it was the wicked\\r\\nlittle man ”So the days passed  and Othmar remained silent and worked with the\\r\\nother young men of the village without speaking  and no longer could\\r\\nhe sing or call the birds to him  Always he looked white and sad \\r\\nbut saddest of all when there was any village merry making  and the\\r\\nvillagers sang and danced together  Then when he heard them he would\\r\\nput his fingers in his ears and hide his eyes so as not to see them and\\r\\nrun afar off by himself  for the sound of any music was quite horrible\\r\\nto him after the singing of the travelling musicians  So a year passed \\r\\nand Othmar never spoke  and instead of calling him the bird boy  the\\r\\nvillage people called him “dumb Othmar ”It was midsummer night  and the villagers had been having a\\r\\nmerry making and dancing cheerily on the green in the village  Othmar\\r\\nwas not with them  he had left the village and went and sat apart on\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 164 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe top of a rocky hill  from where afar the sea could be seen when the\\r\\nweather was clear  The moon was wonderfully bright  and the country\\r\\nwas almost as light as by day  Othmar could hear the sound of their\\r\\nlaughter  but he never laughed  and as he sat with his head bowed upon\\r\\nhis knees he wept silently  So he remained alone till far into the\\r\\nnight when all the singing and dancing was done  and the villagers had\\r\\ngone home  but just when the clocks struck twelve he saw Hulda  who\\r\\ncame slowly to him  and he saw that she too was crying “Othmar ” she said  “I have thought and thought  and I know that the\\r\\nlittle man with the fiddles was a wicked fairy ” Othmar nodded  “So I\\r\\nam going into the big world to find him  for if he has done you this\\r\\nill he will know how to cure you  and I have saved all my money for a\\r\\nyear ”Then Othmar took her hand  and kissed it  but still wept  as he shook\\r\\nhis head and made signs to her that she must not go  as it would be all\\r\\nin vain  But Hulda did not heed him  Pg 165 “And now ” she said  “I am going  Othmar  and it may be long years\\r\\nbefore I return  so you must do three things  First  you must give me\\r\\na long curl of your brown hair  that I may lay it next my heart and\\r\\nwear it day and night  not to forget you  Then you must kiss me on my\\r\\nlips to say good bye  and then you must promise that my name shall be\\r\\nthe first words your lips say when they again can speak ” Then Othmar\\r\\ntook his knife and cut from his head the longest  brightest curl of his\\r\\nhair  and drew her to him and kissed her thrice upon the lips  and then\\r\\nhe took her hand and with it wrote upon his lips her name  “Hulda ” as\\r\\na promise that her name should be the first thing they said “Good bye  Othmar ” she said  “you will wait for me ” Then she turned\\r\\naway and started alone to go down the mountain side  and she looked\\r\\nback as she went and called back  “Good bye  Othmar ” as long as he\\r\\ncould see or hear her She went straight down the hill and journeyed for a long way  till the\\r\\ndawn began to show red in the sky  and she lay under a tree and slept\\r\\nsoundly till the sun had risen and woke her She sat and thought which way she should go  “I must seek out some\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 166 \\r\\n\\r\\nwise man who knows about fairies and wicked witches ” she said to\\r\\nherself  “and who will tell me where to search  And I will ask every\\r\\none I meet where the wisest person is to be found ” So she went on for\\r\\nmany days till she came to a tiny village  outside which  in a field \\r\\nshe saw a shepherd minding sheep  Hulda stopped and asked if he could\\r\\ntell her where she could find a very wise man who could answer her\\r\\nquestion The shepherd thought a bit  and then he said  “The wisest man in these\\r\\nparts lives up in the little cottage on the other side of the village \\r\\nHe cured my sheep two years back when all the flock were sick and many\\r\\ndied—a little cottage with a red gate ” Hulda thanked the shepherd \\r\\nand went on till she came to the little cottage with the red gate  When\\r\\nshe had knocked at the door a tall man came out  and she asked him if\\r\\n’twas he who had cured the shepherd’s sheep  and as he was so clever \\r\\nif he would tell her what to do  She told him she wanted to find a\\r\\ndwarf who led a donkey covered with musical instruments  and whom she\\r\\nknew to be a wicked sorcerer  since he struck folk dumb  Pg 167 The tall man looked at her and said  “My business is to cure sheep \\r\\ncows  and horses  and I know it right well  but I know nothing of\\r\\ndwarfs and witches  and how can I tell you which way he has gone  or\\r\\nanything about him ”“Then of whom had I best ask ” said Hulda  “Tell me who is the wisest\\r\\nand most learned man in these parts  and I will go to him ”The tall man rubbed his head and considered  “I suppose ” quoth he \\r\\n“that the old school master at the village school yonder would be said\\r\\nto be the most learned man hereabouts  for he teaches the children\\r\\nall sorts of things that they forget when they grow up  That is the\\r\\nschool house on the hill ” So on went Hulda again to the school As she came near she could hear the children calling out their lessons \\r\\nand their master  who was an old priest  teaching them  So she waited\\r\\nabout till school hours were over  and the children had all come out \\r\\nand then she timidly went in and curtseyed to the old school master \\r\\nand told him her tale  and asked him  as he was so very learned  if he\\r\\nwould advise her what to do  but instead of answering her the old man\\r\\nat first stared at her in bewilderment  and then he said  “I can teach\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 168 \\r\\n\\r\\nyou to read and write and many wonderful things  but of dwarfs who can\\r\\nsteal a boy’s voice I know nothing  You would do best not to think more\\r\\nof it ”“But some one there must be ” cried Hulda  beginning to cry  “who can\\r\\ntell me what to do  and which way to go  For I am sure that the old man\\r\\nwas a fairy  and if so  no living man can help Othmar  but only he who\\r\\ndid the mischief can undo it ”The old priest looked at her sadly and shook his head  “My child ”\\r\\nhe said  “this is a foolish talk about fairies and sorcerers  I know\\r\\nnothing of such things  It is only untaught folk and fools who give\\r\\nheed to such matters ”“To untaught folk and fools then I must go  for surely they can help\\r\\nme more than the wise ” she cried  So she left the school house  and\\r\\nstarted again through the little village street  The first person\\r\\nshe met was a baker going home after taking round his bread  and she\\r\\nstopped him and asked him who was the most ignorant and foolish person\\r\\nin those parts The baker stood and stared at her  and seemed to be half angry  At\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 169 \\r\\n\\r\\nlast he said  “I am sure I don’t know anything about fools  You had\\r\\nbetter go on to the cake maker  who lives a mile up the hill  He is \\r\\nto my mind  the biggest fool in these parts ” And tossing his basket\\r\\nabout and seeming to be much offended  he went his way  Hulda went on\\r\\nfor a mile up the hill  and there she found a little group of cottages \\r\\nand in their midst was a shop with an open oven  and she could see its\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 170 \\r\\n\\r\\nowner busy making cakes and sweets  Hulda went in and bought a cake \\r\\nand as she sat and ate it  she asked the man timidly if he knew many\\r\\nof the people in that neighbourhood  and if any were very ignorant and\\r\\nfoolish “Indeed ” cried the man  “you may well ask that  Why  a more silly \\r\\nignorant set of folk I never knew  quite different from the people in\\r\\nmy native town  but that is miles away ”“And who do you think the silliest then ” asked Hulda “Why  for sure ’tis hard to say ” said the man  scratching his head \\r\\n“They’re such a poor silly lot  right away from the Mayor down to Tommy\\r\\nthe fool ”“And who is Tommy the fool ” asked Hulda eagerly “’Tis a poor natural born idiot who lives with his mother in the little\\r\\ncabin on the side of the common  He spends all his time trying to catch\\r\\na bird  and he never has caught one  and never will ”“Thank you for telling me about him ” said Hulda  rising to go away \\r\\n“Maybe if he is really a fool he could answer my questions as they\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 171 \\r\\n\\r\\nsay ” and she went on again with a lighter heart  At last she came to\\r\\nthe common on which the fool lived with his mother  When she approached\\r\\nthe little cabin  she saw some one dancing about in front of an oak \\r\\ndressed up with the feathers of birds and fowls  which looked as if\\r\\nthey had been picked up from the ground  He was a young man of about\\r\\neighteen  and he had a cheerful face  but any one looking at him could\\r\\nsee at once he was an idiot  He was dancing round the tree and pointing\\r\\nup to the birds  and calling them to come down to him  Hulda came up\\r\\nand stood quite close and watched him  as he ran round smiling and\\r\\ngiggling  Then she said  “Please can you tell me where I shall find a\\r\\nlittle man  a dwarf who drives a donkey covered with pipes and fiddles ”The fool looked at her very gravely  but he said nothing  so then she\\r\\nwent on to tell him how the little man had come to their village  and\\r\\nhow he had stolen Othmar’s voice  and how she had come out to seek it \\r\\nJust as she finished speaking  there rose from the ground a raven \\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 172 \\r\\n\\r\\nand soared above their heads  When he saw it the fool pointed to it \\r\\nand cried out  “The raven  the raven  follow the raven ” and as the\\r\\nraven flew  he ran after him with Hulda following in turn  They ran\\r\\nfor a long way  the fool leaping and bounding  and pointing with his\\r\\nfinger and crying  “The raven  the raven  do what the raven does ” Then\\r\\nsuddenly he turned  giving a wild laugh  and began to run home again \\r\\nbut as he went he nodded and called to Hulda  “Follow the raven  follow\\r\\nit  do what the raven does ”Hulda felt inclined to burst into tears with disappointment  but still\\r\\nshe ran meekly after the bird  murmuring to herself  “He said follow\\r\\nthe raven  but what good can that do me ” But when the fool had turned\\r\\nback  the raven slackened his pace  and cawed and lighted on a tree \\r\\nand Hulda  panting for breath  sat down under it  and looked up at it “Poor Hulda ” it croaked  but she couldn’t understand it  “poor Hulda \\r\\ncome with me  and I will show you where the dwarf is ” Then it began to\\r\\nfly slowly on again “What shall I do ” sobbed Hulda  “He was only an idiot  he knew\\r\\nnothing  still he told me to follow the raven  and no one else has\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 173 \\r\\n\\r\\ntold me anything ” so on she went  and this time the raven flew quite\\r\\nslowly  so that Hulda kept up with it walking  On they travelled till\\r\\nevening was well advanced  into all sorts of places where Hulda had\\r\\nnever been  and through many villages  Then it began to grow dark  and\\r\\nthe moon came out  but still they travelled on  Hulda was foot sore and\\r\\nweary  but she would not give up  and said to herself  “It was what the\\r\\nfool said  ‘Follow the raven  do what the raven does ’”Just before dawn  they came out on to a big plain  where there were\\r\\nneither houses nor trees  but in the far distance you could see a long\\r\\nline of mountains  a little further in the centre of the plain Hulda\\r\\nsaw a little dark mass  and straight to this the raven flew  and as\\r\\nHulda approached it  she saw that it was the little dwarf  lying asleep\\r\\nupon the ground beside his heap of musical instruments  with the mule\\r\\ngrazing near  “Oh  good wise fool ” cried Hulda  “now indeed you have\\r\\ngiven me the best advice  Since the raven has led me to the wicked\\r\\ndwarf  now indeed will I do what the raven does  whatever it be ”The raven flew on  and lit upon a scrubby bush  a little way from\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 174 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe sleeping dwarf  and Hulda followed and crouched beside it  making\\r\\nno noise lest she should disturb the sleeper  and hiding behind the\\r\\nbranches so that she could not be seen  Presently the little man\\r\\nrose from the ground  and called out  “Come  my children  practice \\r\\npractice  the dawn is here  and the sun will rise  and then we must go\\r\\nupon our way ”Then Hulda saw what Othmar had seen before  The pipes raised themselves\\r\\nfrom the ground  and untwisted  and became tall  lithe men  some\\r\\ngradually uncurled themselves  and put forth long arms and became\\r\\nbeautiful girls  till each instrument had taken the likeness of a human\\r\\nbeing  Then they began to dance and to sing  and Hulda watched them\\r\\nas Othmar had watched them  and she too felt as if she had never seen\\r\\nand heard anything so beautiful in her life  and she longed to rush to\\r\\nthem  but she heard the raven croak above her  and remembered the words\\r\\nof the fool  “The raven  the raven  do what the raven does ” Then she\\r\\nsaw that the raven had hopped off the tree  and was standing upon the\\r\\nearth in front of her  and was beginning to dig in the earth with its\\r\\nlong beak  as if it would find a worm  “The fool said  Do what the\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 175 \\r\\n\\r\\nraven does  so must I dig too ” thought she  and she began to scoop the\\r\\nbrown earth with her hand  till she had made a hole  watching the raven\\r\\nall the time Presently she saw that the raven had found a long worm  and held it by\\r\\nits throat in the air  but it did not swallow it  Hulda looked into her\\r\\nhole to see if there was a worm there also  and at the bottom she saw\\r\\nlying a long  lithe  green snake  twisted up and apparently torpid \\r\\n“Surely ” thought Hulda  “if I do what the raven does  I shall take\\r\\nthis out ” and she put her hand into the hole  and grasped the snake\\r\\nby its throat  though she was very much afraid of it  and then she\\r\\ncrouched down behind the raven and the bush “Come ” cried the dwarf  when they had all sung together  “now let us\\r\\nhear the last new voice  Othmar’s voice was as sweet as silver  Now\\r\\nlet me hear how my youngest daughter has treated it ” Then there came\\r\\nto the front the youngest and fairest of the girls  and began to sing \\r\\nand when she heard it  Hulda could scarcely keep from screaming  for\\r\\nshe recognized that the tones were Othmar’s  but just as the singing\\r\\nsounded the sweetest  the raven with a croak opened his mouth  and\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 176 \\r\\n\\r\\ndropped the worm upon the ground  and Hulda let go her hold of the\\r\\nbright green snake  which darted through the short grass towards the\\r\\ndancers There arose from all sides the cry of “A snake  a snake ” and they\\r\\nseemed panic stricken  The snake glided straight towards the singing\\r\\ngirl  and deftly coiled itself round her ankles  while from the old\\r\\nman and all the others came a terrible uproar  but the snake from the\\r\\ngirl’s ankles had slid up her body in bright green coils  and then\\r\\ntwisted itself around her throat  and coiled tighter and tighter and\\r\\ntighter  till her head fell over on one side  Then Hulda heard a noise\\r\\nlike the sighing of wind  but sweet and tender  while the dwarf and all\\r\\nthe singers were in a hubbub and confusion For a moment the old man stood motionless  then he rose and gave a\\r\\nterrible cry  Hulda trembled when she heard his voice  it sounded like\\r\\nnothing earthly  but ere he was silent there had risen from the ground\\r\\nand from the bushes near a number of little cloudy forms  black and\\r\\nthick  and twirling in all directions  and they twisted in and out\\r\\namong the singers  and as they twisted among them  they ceased to be\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 177 \\r\\n\\r\\nmen and women  but became musical instruments  as they had been before \\r\\nall save the girl around whose neck the snake had wound  and who seemed\\r\\nto shrivel and shrivel in its coils till she was no more to be seen In less than a minute they were all packed again upon the mule  and the\\r\\nlittle old man was leading it quietly away  as if nothing had happened \\r\\nAnd upon the grass lay the glittering snake  though all trace of the\\r\\ngirl around whose neck it had twisted had gone  Hulda ran to it  and\\r\\nthen she almost cried  for she feared that after all the girl with\\r\\nOthmar’s voice had escaped her  But she remembered the words of Tommy\\r\\nthe fool  “Do as the raven does  follow the raven ” and looking up\\r\\nshe saw that the raven was fluttering above her  with the worm it had\\r\\npicked up from the ground in its mouth “Oh  dear raven ” cried Hulda  “you brought me to where the little man\\r\\nwas  now lead me back and show me what to do next ” And mindful of the\\r\\nfool’s advice  she picked up the snake  and holding it firmly by the\\r\\nthroat  turned to follow the raven  who flew ahead of her  Thus they\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 178 \\r\\n\\r\\njourneyed back  over the same country through which Hulda had come\\r\\nbefore  All looked just the same  but Hulda was sorely tired  for she\\r\\nhad now been walking many days  and she felt sad  for she did not know\\r\\nif after all she had gained anything  or whether she ought not to have\\r\\nfollowed the little old man  and though she had heard Othmar’s voice \\r\\nshe did not know how she was to get it back to him  “Never mind ” she\\r\\nsaid to herself  “the fool told me right so far  and evidently he knew\\r\\nall about it  so I had best keep to his advice ”The sun rose high in the sky and the day was very hot  and poor Hulda\\r\\nlonged to lie down under the trees and sleep  moreover the snake in her\\r\\nhand twisted and twisted  till she could scarce hold it  Sometimes she\\r\\ncried from very weariness  but still the raven flew in front of her \\r\\nShe had bought dry bread as she came along  and when the raven stopped\\r\\nand hopped upon the ground  she munched it to stave off her hunger \\r\\nbut directly the raven began to fly she followed it  and she never let\\r\\nthe snake from her grasp  The sun had set  and dark was all over the\\r\\nland ere she came to the village where the fool lived  but no fool was\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 179 \\r\\n\\r\\nthere to be seen  Hulda sought everywhere  but she could not find him \\r\\nThen she saw that the raven had stopped and settled on the roof of the\\r\\ncottage where the fool lived  and  standing on one leg  had gone to\\r\\nsleep with its head under its wing  so Hulda lay down by the side of\\r\\nthe door  and laying her head on a stone rested too  But first she took\\r\\noff her girdle and tied it firmly round the snake’s throat  and then\\r\\ntied it round her waist again lest she should fall asleep and the snake\\r\\nglide away Just when the stars were beginning to look pale  and as there were\\r\\nsigns of the dawn in the sky  the door of the cottage opened  and out\\r\\nthere came the fool  dressed up as Hulda had seen him before  with\\r\\nfeathers and weeds and bits of bright rag  Hulda started up  and he\\r\\nlaughed when he saw her  “Look ” he said  “the sun is rising  I am come\\r\\nout to see it ”“I have come back ” cried Hulda  “and I have seen them all—the old\\r\\nman and the musician girls  and the one who stole Othmar’s voice will\\r\\nnever use it again  for this snake has throttled her  but what am I to\\r\\ndo now  How can I give him back his voice  What shall I do to make him\\r\\nspeak ” And as she spoke she took the snake from her bosom and showed\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 180 \\r\\n\\r\\nit to the fool  He looked at it very gravely as he always did when\\r\\nanything was shown to him  and looked very wise and nodded  “It is a\\r\\nsnake ” he said  “perhaps Othmar will like the snake ”Hulda begged him to tell her if he knew what she should do  but he\\r\\nwould say no more  but began to dance and sing as she had seen him do\\r\\nbefore  Then at last Hulda burst out crying  “He is nothing but a poor\\r\\nidiot ” she said  “and I have been on a fool’s errand when I did as he\\r\\ntold me  though I did see the wicked little man  and this snake did\\r\\npunish the singing girl  so I will take it back to Othmar that he may\\r\\nsee I have tried  But now I believe he will be dumb for ever ”And she took the snake and looked at it as she held it  It was very\\r\\nstill  and seemed half torpid  though the weather was warm  She saw it\\r\\nwas not a common snake  for it was bright brown  and green with odd\\r\\nmarkings  and it glittered oddly when the sun’s rays touched it “I will go back now ” said Hulda  “I will go back to Othmar  and tell\\r\\nhim I have failed  and ask him to forgive my vanity in thinking\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 181 \\r\\n\\r\\nI could help him  I will go back at once and tell him all ” And\\r\\noverhead the raven croaked and told her to go quickly  but she did not\\r\\nunderstand what he said So again she began to trudge on  holding the snake in her hands and\\r\\ntoiling over fields and moors in the way that she knew led to her own\\r\\nlittle village  though by now her feet were so swollen and her legs so\\r\\nstiff that she almost cried for pain Presently she came to the village where the cake maker lived  and as\\r\\nshe passed his shop  she saw that he stood at the door and nodded to\\r\\nher as he saw her coming “Good day ” he cried  “you are the young wench I saw go past awhile\\r\\nback ”“Yes  I am going home now ” said Hulda “And have you found your fiddles and horns that turned to men and\\r\\nwomen ” he asked  “It was a fool’s errand  I fear  you were going on \\r\\nand what have you got in your hand now ”“It is a snake ” answered Hulda  “and——”“A snake ” screamed the cake maker  “Lord love the girl  is she mad to\\r\\ngo wandering over the country carrying a snake with her  Why  it might\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 182 \\r\\n\\r\\nkill you  wench  Drop it at once ”“No  indeed  I will not drop it ” said Hulda  “for it seems to me that\\r\\nit is the only thing which may do Othmar good  for at any rate it has\\r\\nkilled the girl who stole his voice  and——”At this the man started and called out  “Good Lord  she is clean off\\r\\nher head  Stolen Othmar’s voice  What can the wench mean  Why  girl \\r\\nthat snake might bite you  and you would be dead at once  Why on earth\\r\\nshould you carry it because it has killed a girl ”“I am carrying it because the fool told me to do what the raven does ”\\r\\nanswered Hulda  “and he has still a worm in his mouth  Look ”At this the man burst out laughing  “Why  what has that to do with\\r\\nyou ” he cried  “a raven will often carry a worm for a bit  Drop this\\r\\nsnake at once  you silly lass  or  better still  hold it firm while I\\r\\ncrush its head with my poker ” And he seized the poker to kill it with Then Hulda was frightened lest he might steal the snake from her  or\\r\\nkill it by force  and she ran on  but she ran in such haste that she\\r\\nstumbled against the baker who was just coming out from his shop with\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 183 \\r\\n\\r\\nhis basket of loaves on his arm “Can’t you look where you are going ” he cried in anger  as he picked\\r\\nup the bread which had rolled into the road  and then  seeing it was\\r\\nHulda  he said —“Why  who are you running away from  my girl  Are you\\r\\non the look out for more fools that you can’t see when an honest man\\r\\ncomes along  And whatever have you got there ”“It is only a snake I have found ” said Hulda  when she had asked the\\r\\nman’s pardon  and she tried to hide the snake in her skirt  but the\\r\\nbaker seized her arm and made her show it to him “What on earth are you carrying a live snake with you for ” he asked \\r\\n“Don’t you know they are venomous beasts  and the bite of one is\\r\\ncertain death ” And  like the cake maker  he tried to wrench the snake\\r\\nfrom her  At this Hulda was terribly frightened “If they take the snake from me ” she thought  “then my last chance is\\r\\ngone ” and she tried to free herself from the baker  but he seized her\\r\\nby the skirt and held her fast  and shouted out to others to come and\\r\\nhelp him  Pg 184 “Help  help ” he cried  “Here is a poor mad girl  and she has got hold\\r\\nof a poisonous adder  and she will let it loose in the village and it\\r\\nwill bite some of our children and kill them ” And when they heard his\\r\\ncry the villagers all came running out of their cottages “Let me go  let me go ” shrieked Hulda  “it will do no harm  I will\\r\\nhold it tight  and I would not lose it for the wide world ”“I tell you she is mad ” roared the baker  and the cake maker came up\\r\\nand said the same thing  “She wandered by here some time back  and all\\r\\nshe wanted to know was where she could find another as mad as herself \\r\\nbut she will have far to go before she meets one  I reckon  We must\\r\\nsecure her and take the snake from her  but beware how you catch it \\r\\nfor fear it should bite ”And the people all gathered round her and made a great hubbub  though\\r\\nthey were afraid to touch the snake which Hulda still held firmly in\\r\\nher hand  And they made such a din that the old school master came out\\r\\nof the school house with his pupils after him The people told him there was a poor mad girl who had got a snake  and\\r\\nwould not let them take it from her  and he remembered Hulda as the\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 185 \\r\\n\\r\\nothers had done  and shook his head and said sadly  “I fear it is too\\r\\ntrue  The poor child is really mad  but we cannot wrench the snake from\\r\\nher lest it may turn and bite us  But it is certain that it would not\\r\\nbe safe to let her go  so  as the children are all going home now  let\\r\\nus lock her into the school house here  till we can get something to\\r\\nkill the creature with  and then when the doctor comes  he can see if\\r\\nthe poor girl is very bad  and what had better be done with her ”Hulda turned quite white with fear  and cried out that she was not mad \\r\\nand that the snake should harm no one  but they would not heed her \\r\\nand pushed her into the school house  and bolted the doors on her  and\\r\\nthere Hulda sat on the floor and cried as if her heart would break “Alas ” cried she  “now all hope is gone  and Othmar will be dumb for\\r\\never  For what good have I carried this snake with me all this way  if\\r\\nnow it is to be taken from me and killed ” and her tears fell on the\\r\\nviper as she looked at it in her hand  It was very bright green and\\r\\nyellow  and it kept wrinkling and twisting its skin as she grasped\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 186 \\r\\n\\r\\nit  and making a loud hissing noise  As her tears were still falling\\r\\nshe heard a croak over her head  and saw the raven perched on a window\\r\\nabove her  and again her hopes revived “Maybe he has come to help me ” she thought  “for I should never have\\r\\nfound the little dwarf if it had not been for the raven ” Then as she\\r\\nlooked up at the raven sitting in the window  she saw that it was\\r\\npecking at a piece of rope that hung through the window  and Hulda\\r\\nthought—“Surely if I could climb up to the window  I could scramble\\r\\nthrough it  and climb down the rope on to the ground  Only if they were\\r\\nto see me  they would catch me again  so I must wait till nightfall\\r\\nwhen there is no one there ”So she sat down again and waited till the sun had set  and she trembled\\r\\nat every noise lest it might be some one coming to seek her  but they\\r\\nleft her alone  and no one came  When it was quite dark  and all the\\r\\nvillage was quiet she went to the window  and tried to climb up to it \\r\\nbut she found that she could not manage to get up on to the window sill\\r\\nwhile she held the snake in her hand  Then first she thought she would\\r\\nwind it around her waist  but she remembered how it had tightened\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 187 \\r\\n\\r\\naround the singing girl and killed her  and for some time she could\\r\\nnot think what to do with it  At last she twisted it into a knot  and\\r\\nplaced it in her bosom  though she trembled lest it should bite her \\r\\nAnd when she placed it in her bosom  she saw the curl of Othmar’s hair\\r\\nthat lay there  and she took it and tied up the snake’s jaws with it so\\r\\nthat it might not open its mouth  “For Othmar’s hair will not break or\\r\\ngive way ” she said  “it is like his heart  it will be true and strong\\r\\ntill the end ”Then she climbed up on to the window ledge  and scrambled through the\\r\\nwindow  and took the piece of rope and let herself down on to the\\r\\nground outside  And when she lit upon the ground  she heard the raven\\r\\ncroaking above her  and her heart leapt for joy  and she began to run\\r\\nas fast as she could to get away from the village lest they might catch\\r\\nher again When she came again into the open country  she looked for the raven \\r\\nand saw that it was flying in front of her as before  towards the\\r\\ndistant mountains where she knew lay her home  She toiled on  for many\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 188 \\r\\n\\r\\ndays  but by now the summer had nearly passed away  and when she got\\r\\ninto the high mountain land  she found that the cold winter had given\\r\\nsigns of coming  and the trees were beginning to be bare  and there was\\r\\na light white frost on the ground  It was far into the night when she\\r\\narrived in the village  and the villagers were all asleep and their\\r\\ncottages shut  Outside the cottage where Othmar lived grew a big old\\r\\nivy tree  and on this the raven perched  and underneath it Hulda lay\\r\\ndown to wait the dawn and Othmar’s waking  She lay quiet for a bit \\r\\nbut when she saw a faint glimmering of light where the sun was going\\r\\nto rise  she felt she could be still no longer  and she sprang up and\\r\\ncalled  “Othmar  come down  I am here ” for she dreaded having to tell\\r\\nhim before the other villagers that she had failed In a few moments the door of the cottage opened and Othmar came out \\r\\nand ran to greet her  but she kept afar “Othmar ” she cried  “I have done you no good  save that I have\\r\\npunished the wicked girl who took your voice  This snake killed her  so\\r\\nshe will never sing as you did again  See ” And she held out the snake\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 189 \\r\\n\\r\\nto him  it was curled round and still tied up with his hair  and as the\\r\\nsun began to shine it glittered brightly “But I have done you no good  indeed rather harm ” Hulda went on  “for\\r\\nI have made you hope where there was no hope  and you have waited and\\r\\nexpected that I should bring you back what you had lost  and I have not\\r\\ndone it  and now I shall never hear you say my name ‘Hulda’ again ” and\\r\\nshe wept so bitterly that the tears fell from her face  and dropped\\r\\nupon the snake which still she grasped  Othmar held out his hand  and\\r\\ntried to take her hand that he might kiss it  and as he did so  he\\r\\ntouched the snake’s long tail  and it began to writhe and twist  and\\r\\nglisten more and more as the sun shone on it  And as he raised her hand\\r\\nto his mouth  Othmar tried to say her name “Hulda” with his poor dumb\\r\\nlips that could make no sound  and he breathed it on the snake  and it\\r\\nseemed as if the snake vibrated with the name  and suddenly it swelled\\r\\nand swelled  and shone still more brightly  and its mouth grew wide and\\r\\nburst Othmar’s hair which had bound it  and widened out till it was not\\r\\na snake any more  but a curled golden trumpet  curled up as the snake\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 190 \\r\\n\\r\\nhad been  and like that which had been changed into the singing girl\\r\\nwho stole Othmar’s voice  “Take it  Othmar  and blow ” cried Hulda \\r\\nand he put it to his lips and cried “Hulda ” and Hulda heard her name\\r\\nechoing back in a burst of music from all around  At its sound the\\r\\nbirds awoke in all the trees  and began their morning chorus  and the\\r\\nvillage folk ran to their windows to see what the trumpet’s peal had\\r\\nbeen  and saw Othmar standing with Hulda in his arms  and at their feet\\r\\nthe bright trumpet which he had dropped  It lay on the ground  but as\\r\\nOthmar began to speak and to say  “Hulda  Hulda  you have brought it\\r\\nback  you have given me my voice again ” the trumpet broke into many\\r\\npieces  and with every word crumbled  till there was nothing left but\\r\\na little heap of shining golden sand  and from under it there glided\\r\\nout a dark green snake with yellow markings  and it slid away into the\\r\\nbushes and disappeared Then all the villagers rejoiced  and Hulda wept with happiness  And\\r\\nOthmar married Hulda  and his voice never left him again  but when\\r\\nlong years after folk would tell him his voice was sweet and far more\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 191 \\r\\n\\r\\nbeautiful than the birds  he would say  “But it is not really my voice \\r\\nit is my wife’s  Hulda’s  for I should have been dumb for ever if she\\r\\nhad not sought it and brought it back to me ” Pg 192 \\nOnce upon a time there lived a shepherd and his wife  who lived in\\r\\na very lonely little cottage far from town or village  near some\\r\\nmountains  It was a wild neighbourhood  and the wind blew across the\\r\\nmountains fiercely  and the rain often fell so heavily that it seemed\\r\\nas if the cottage would be washed away  One evening when the shepherd\\r\\nwas out  there came on a great storm of rain which beat against the\\r\\ndoors and the windows violently  As the shepherd’s wife sat listening\\r\\nto it by the fire  it seemed to her as if it sounded louder than she\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 193 \\r\\n\\r\\nhad ever heard it before  and the raindrops sounded like the knock of\\r\\na hand that was knocking to gain admittance  It went on for a little\\r\\ntime  till the shepherd’s wife could bear to listen to it no longer \\r\\nand she rose and went to the door to open it  though she knew that\\r\\nshe would let the wind and rain into the room  As she opened the door\\r\\na gust of rain was blown in her face  and then she saw that in the\\r\\ndoorway stood a woman who had been knocking  She was a tall woman\\r\\nwrapped in a grey cloak with long hair falling down her back  “Thank\\r\\nyou ” she said  And though her voice was very low  the shepherd’s wife\\r\\ncould hear it plainly through all the storm  “Thank you for opening the\\r\\ndoor to me  Many would have let me stand outside  Now may I come into\\r\\nyour cottage and rest ”“How wet you must be ” cried the shepherd’s wife  “come in and rest \\r\\nand let me give you food  Have you come from far ”“No  I come from quite near ” said the woman  and she came into the\\r\\ncottage as she spoke  and sat down in a chair near the door  “And I\\r\\nwant no food  only a glass of water  I must go on directly  but I have\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 194 \\r\\n\\r\\nnot far to go  and I shall be no wetter than I am now ”The shepherd’s wife stared in surprise  for she saw that apparently\\r\\nthe woman’s clothes were not wet at all  And what was stranger still \\r\\nthough she had thought she was only clad in a dull grey cloak  now she\\r\\nsaw that she was covered with jewellery —clear stones  like diamonds\\r\\nwith many flashing colours  and she also saw that all her clothes were\\r\\nof the finest  She gave her a glass of water  and begged that as well\\r\\nshe might give her other food  but the woman shook her head  and said\\r\\nno  water was all she needed  When she had drunk the water she gave\\r\\nback the glass to the shepherd’s wife  and said  “And so this is your\\r\\nhome  Have you all that you want in life  Are you happy ”“Ay  we are happy enough ” said the shepherd’s wife  “save indeed for\\r\\none thing  Ten years ago my little baby girl died  and I have no other\\r\\nchildren  I long for one sorely  that I might take care of it and make\\r\\nit happy  while it is little  and then in turn  when I am old  it would\\r\\nlove and care for me ”“And if you had a little child ” said the woman  rising up and\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 195 \\r\\n\\r\\nstanding before the shepherd’s wife  “you think you would really love\\r\\nit better than anything in the world  Many women say that  but few do\\r\\nit  Before long a little child will be born to you  and as long as you\\r\\nlove it better than anything in the world it will remain with you  but\\r\\nwhen you love anything else better than your little daughter and her\\r\\nhappiness  it will go from you  so remember my words  Good bye ” and\\r\\nthe woman walked to the door and went quietly out into the rain  and\\r\\nthe shepherd’s wife saw her disappearing  and the rain pelting around\\r\\nher  but her clothes were not blown about  neither did the rain seem to\\r\\nwet her A year passed away  and the shepherd’s wife had a tiny daughter  a\\r\\nlovely little baby with the bluest eyes and the softest skin  the\\r\\nevening she was born the wind howled and the rain fell as fiercely as\\r\\non the night when the grey woman had come into the shepherd’s cottage \\r\\nThe shepherd and his wife both loved their little daughter very dearly \\r\\nas well they might  as no fairer child was ever seen  But as she grew\\r\\nolder  some things about her frightened her mother  and she had some\\r\\nways of which she could not cure her  Pg 196 She would never go near a fire  however cold she was  neither did\\r\\nshe love the sunshine  but always ran from it and crept into the shade \\r\\nbut when she heard the rain pattering against the window panes she\\r\\nwould cry  “Listen  mother  listen to my brothers and sisters dancing ”\\r\\nand then she would begin to dance too in the cottage  her little feet\\r\\npattering upon the boards  or  if she possibly could  she would run\\r\\nout on to the moor and dance  with the rain falling upon her  and her\\r\\nmother had much ado to get her to come back into the cottage  yet she\\r\\nnever seemed to get very wet  nor did she catch cold  Pg 197 A river ran near the cottage  and by it she would go\\r\\nand sit for hours dabbling her feet in the water  and singing sweet\\r\\nlittle songs to herself Still  in all other ways she was a good \\r\\naffectionate girl  and did all that her mother told her  and seemed\\r\\nto love both her parents tenderly  and the shepherd’s wife would say\\r\\nto herself  “My only trouble is that when she is grown up  she will\\r\\nwant to marry  and leave me  and I shall have to do without her ” Time\\r\\npassed  and the old shepherd died  but his wife and daughter still\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 198 \\r\\n\\r\\nlived on in the little cottage  and the daughter grew to be a most\\r\\nbeautiful young maiden  Her eyes were clear light blue  like the colour\\r\\nof the far off sea  but it was difficult to say what was the colour of\\r\\nher hair  save that it was very light  and hung in heavy masses over\\r\\nher brow and shoulders  Once or twice her mother felt sorely frightened\\r\\nabout her  it was when spring showers were falling  and the young\\r\\ngirl had gone into the little garden in front of the cottage to let\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 199 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe rain fall upon her head and face  as she loved to do  in spite of\\r\\nall her mother could say  Then she began to dance  as she always did\\r\\nwhen the rain fell  and as she danced the sun came out while the rain\\r\\nwas yet falling  Her mother watched her from the cottage window  but\\r\\nwhile she watched her it seemed to her as if her daughter was covered\\r\\nwith jewels of every colour  clear and bright  they hung around her in\\r\\nchains  and made her look more like a king’s daughter than a shepherd’s\\r\\ngirl  “Come in  child  come in ” called the shepherd’s wife  and when\\r\\nthe young girl came in the cottage all traces of the jewels had gone \\r\\nand when her mother upbraided her for going out to dance in the rain \\r\\nshe only answered  “It hurts no one  my mother  and it pleases me  why\\r\\nshould you stop me ”A little way from the cottage on the mountain side stood an old castle \\r\\nwhere formerly the Kings of the land used to come and stay  but which\\r\\nnow had not been used for very many years  One day  however  the\\r\\nshepherd’s wife saw great preparations were being made to beautify and\\r\\nadorn it  and she knew that the King and his son were coming to stay\\r\\nthere again  Soon after they had arrived  the shepherd’s daughter went\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 200 \\r\\n\\r\\ndown to the river  as was her wont  and sat on the bank  dipping her\\r\\nfeet in the ripples  Presently there came up a boat  and it was a grand\\r\\nyoung man dressed all in velvet and gold who leaned over the side to\\r\\nfish “Who are you  and what are you doing here ” cried the shepherd’s\\r\\ndaughter  for she was afraid of no one “I am the King’s son ” said he  “and I am coming here to fish  Who are\\r\\nyou  and where do you come from  for I have never seen such a beautiful\\r\\nmaiden in my life ” and he looked at her and could scarce speak  so\\r\\nbeautiful did she seem to him “It is cruel to take the fishes out of the water ” cried the shepherd’s\\r\\ndaughter  “leave them alone  and come and dance on the bank with me ”\\r\\nand she went under the shade of a large tree  and began to dance  and\\r\\nthe King’s son watched her  and again he thought so beautiful a maid\\r\\nthere had never been  Pg 201 2  Pg 203 Day after day he came down to the river to fish  and day after day he\\r\\nleft the line and tackle to sit and watch the shepherd’s daughter  and\\r\\neach time found her more enchanting  Once he tried to kiss her\\r\\nhand  but she sprang from him and left him sitting in his boat alone \\r\\nAt last a day came when the Prince said to his father  “My father  you\\r\\nwant me to wed so that I may have an heir to the throne  but there is\\r\\nonly one woman that can ever be my wife  and that is the daughter of\\r\\nthe poor woman who lives in the little cottage out yonder ”At first the old King was very wroth  but he loved his son well  and\\r\\nknew that nothing would shake him from his word  so he told him that if\\r\\nhe would bring home his bride  he too would rejoice and love her as his\\r\\ndaughter even though she be a beggar maid  Then the young Prince rode\\r\\ndown to the cottage  and went in and told the shepherd’s wife how he\\r\\nhad seen her daughter  and loved her and wished to make her his wife \\r\\nso that she would be Queen of the country The shepherd’s wife went nearly wild with joy  “To think that my\\r\\ndaughter should be the Queen ” she said to herself  and when her\\r\\ndaughter came into the cottage she did not know how to contain herself \\r\\nbut folded her in her arms and kissed her  crying and declaring that\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 204 \\r\\n\\r\\nnever was woman so blessed “Why  what has happened  my mother  and what has pleased you so ” said\\r\\nher daughter  while still the shepherd’s wife rejoiced and wept for joy “It is the King’s son  my girl  the King’s own son  and he has just\\r\\nbeen here  and he loves you because you are so beautiful  and he will\\r\\nmarry you and make you Queen of all the land  Was there ever such luck\\r\\nfor a poor woman ”But the daughter only said  “But I don’t want to marry the King’s son \\r\\nmother  or any one  I will never be the wife of any man  I will stay\\r\\nwith you and nurse you when you are old and sick  for I can live in no\\r\\nhouse but this cottage  and have no friend but my mother ”On hearing this the shepherd’s wife became very angry  and told her\\r\\ndaughter that she must be mad  and that she must wait for a day or two \\r\\nand she would be only too thankful for the love of the King’s son  and\\r\\nfor the honour he was going to do her in making her his Queen  But\\r\\nstill the daughter shook her head  and said quite quietly  “I will\\r\\nnever be the wife of the King’s son ” The shepherd’s wife did not dare\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 205 \\r\\n\\r\\ntell the King’s son what her daughter had said  but told him that he\\r\\nhad better speak to her himself if he wished to make her his wife  Then\\r\\nwhen he was again sitting in the boat on the river  and the maiden on\\r\\nthe bank  the King’s son told her how much he loved her  and that he\\r\\nwould share with her all that he had in this world  But the shepherd’s\\r\\ndaughter only shook her head and said  “I will never live at the\\r\\npalace  and I will never be a Queen ”The old King had ordered great preparations to be made for the wedding \\r\\nwhich was to take place immediately  and all sorts of fine clothes were\\r\\nordered for the shepherd’s daughter  that she might appear properly as\\r\\nthe wife of the Prince  but for the few days just before the wedding \\r\\nthe rain fell as it had never been known to have fallen  it beat\\r\\nthrough the roofs of the cottages  and the river swelled and overflowed\\r\\nits banks  everyone was frightened  save indeed the shepherd’s\\r\\ndaughter  who went out into the wet and danced as was her wont  letting\\r\\nthe torrents fall upon her head and shoulders But the evening before the wedding day she knelt beside her mother’s\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 206 \\r\\n\\r\\nside  “Dear mother ” she said  “let me stop with you and nurse you when\\r\\nyou are old  Do not send me away to the palace to live with the King’s\\r\\nson ”Then the mother was very angry  and told her daughter that she was very\\r\\nungrateful  and she ought to be thankful that such luck had come in her\\r\\nway  and who was she  the daughter of a poor shepherd  that she should\\r\\nobject to marrying the King’s son All night long the rain fell in torrents  and when next day the\\r\\nshepherd’s daughter was dressed in all her finery  it was through pools\\r\\non the ground that she had to step into the grand carriage which the\\r\\nKing had sent to fetch her  and while the marriage service was being\\r\\nread  the priest’s voice could scarcely be heard for the pattering of\\r\\nthe drops upon the roof  and when they went into the castle to the\\r\\nbanquet  the water burst through the doors opened to receive them \\r\\nso that the King and the wedding guests had hard ado to keep dry  It\\r\\nwas a grand feast  and the King’s son sat at one end of the table \\r\\nand his young wife was beside him dressed in white and gold  All the\\r\\ncourtiers and all the fine guests declared that surely the world had\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nnever contained such a beautiful young woman as their future Queen  But\\r\\njust when the goblets were filled with wine  to drink to the health of\\r\\nthe bride and bridegroom  there came a cry  “The floods  the floods ”\\r\\nand the servants ran into the hall  crying out that the waters were\\r\\npouring in  and in one moment the rooms were filled with water  and no\\r\\none thought of anything but to save themselves  When the hurricane had\\r\\nsubsided  and the waters gone down  they looked around for the Prince’s\\r\\nwife  who was nowhere to be found  Every one said that she had been\\r\\nswept away by the torrents  and that she had been drowned in all her\\r\\nyouth and beauty  only the shepherd’s wife wept alone  and remembered\\r\\nthe words of the woman who came to her on the night of the storm  “When\\r\\nyou love aught on earth better than your daughter and her happiness \\r\\nshe will go from you ”The King’s son mourned his wife  and for long would not be comforted \\r\\nbut when many years had passed  he married a beautiful Princess  and\\r\\nwith her lived very happily  only when the rain fell in torrents and\\r\\nbeat against the window panes it would seem to him as if he heard the\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 208 \\r\\n\\r\\nsound of dancing feet  and a voice that called out  “Come and dance\\r\\nwith me  come and dance with me and my brothers and sisters  oh  King’s\\r\\nson  and feel our drops upon your face ” Pg 209 \\nA Young ploughman was following his plough in a field one morning when\\r\\nsuddenly the horses stopped  and do what he would he could not make\\r\\nthem stir  Then he tried to push the plough himself  but he could\\r\\nnot move it one hair’s breadth  He stooped down to see what could be\\r\\nstopping it  when a deep voice cried  “Stop  I am coming up ” The\\r\\nvoice was so loud that the ploughman shook with fear  but though he\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 210 \\r\\n\\r\\nlooked all around him  he could see no one from whom it could come \\r\\nBut presently it spoke again  only this time it was a little lower  \\r\\nand called out  “Have patience  and I shall be up in a moment ” The\\r\\nploughman quaked in every limb  and stood quite still  and the voice\\r\\nbegan again  but this time it was no louder than most folks’   and it\\r\\nsaid—“If you will only not be in such a hurry  I will tell you what I\\r\\nwant  Look in front of your horse’s right foot  and pick me up ”He bent down and looked on the ground  and there in the earth  just in\\r\\nfront of his horse’s right foot  he saw what he thought was a little\\r\\nblack lizard  He touched it very cautiously  and started back with\\r\\nsurprise when the voice spoke again  and he found it came from this\\r\\ntiny creature “Yes ” it said  “that is quite right  You can pick me up in your hand\\r\\nif you like  but I think I must grow a little bigger  as I am really\\r\\nuncomfortably small ” and while he held it on the palm of his hand \\r\\nthe ploughman saw that it was beginning to grow larger  and it swelled\\r\\nso fast that in a few seconds it was near a foot high  and he had to\\r\\ntake both hands to hold it  Then he saw that it was not a lizard  but\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 211 \\r\\n\\r\\na little black woman with a face that looked as though it were made of\\r\\nindia rubber  and ugly little black hands “There  that will do ” said the strange little gnome  “That is a nice\\r\\nuseful size  Oh dear  how tiring growing is  I don’t think I’ll be any\\r\\nbigger just yet  Now be sure you don’t drop me  and handle me very\\r\\ncarefully  for I do not like to be roughly touched  I have not slept\\r\\nnearly as long as I meant to  I wanted a hundred years’ nap  and it\\r\\ncannot be more than fifty  but now that I am awake I think I will keep\\r\\nso for a bit  You seem to be rather a nice civil young man  How would\\r\\nyou like to take me for a lodger ”“A lodger ” gasped the ploughman  “Why  what should I do with you ”“I should give no trouble ” said the gnome  “But are there any women in\\r\\nyour house ”“No ” said the ploughman  “for I have no wife  and I am too poor to\\r\\nkeep a servant ”“So much the better ” said the gnome  “For though I am a woman myself \\r\\nI detest women  and only get on with men ” Pg 212 “You a woman ” cried the ploughman  and he laughed outright “Of course I am a woman ” said the creature  “Come  say quickly  do you\\r\\nlike to have me for a lodger or not  Of course you will have to agree\\r\\nto my terms ”“And what are your terms ” asked the ploughman “Only this  Whatever comes into the house  you must always give the\\r\\nbest of it to me  I will choose where I shall live for myself  when I\\r\\nsee the house  but of all the food you have  you must save the best and\\r\\ngive it to me  Not much of it  but the very best pieces  As you are\\r\\na man I cannot wear your clothes  but you can give me some of their\\r\\nmaterial  and of everything else that comes into the house of any sort \\r\\ntobacco  or carpets  or furniture  I must have some of the best  And at\\r\\nmeals I must always be helped first  If you agree to this  I may stay\\r\\nwith you for a very long time ”“Oh  oh ” said the ploughman  “and pray what shall I get by it  It\\r\\nseems to me as if you wanted to get the best of everything and give\\r\\nnothing in return ” Pg 213 “On the contrary ” replied the gnome  “I shall give a very great deal \\r\\nFor as long as I remain in your house  all things will go well with\\r\\nyou  You are a poor man now  but you will soon be a rich one  If you\\r\\nsow seeds they will give twice as much crop as other people’s  All your\\r\\nanimals will do well  and in a little time  instead of being a poor\\r\\nploughman  you will be the richest farmer in the countryside ”“Well ” quoth the ploughman  “I don’t mind trying  I think it would\\r\\nrather amuse me to take you to my cottage  but if you don’t keep your\\r\\npart of the bargain  and I don’t find things are going very well with\\r\\nme  I warn you I’ll pretty soon turn you out ”“Agreed ” said the gnome  “but remember  if you fail in your compact\\r\\nwith me  I shall go by myself  Now carry me home and let me choose\\r\\nwhere I will live ”The ploughman carried the odd little figure back to his cottage  gaping\\r\\nwith astonishment  there he put it down on the kitchen table in the\\r\\nlittle kitchen  It looked all round it  and twisted about its little\\r\\nblack head “That will do nicely ” it said at last  “there is a little hole in\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 214 \\r\\n\\r\\nthat corner  down which I can go  and near that hole you must place all\\r\\nyour daintiest bits  and remember that I must always be helped first\\r\\nat all your meals ” And without a word it leaped from the table  and\\r\\nscuttled away down a big hole that the rats had made  and was no more\\r\\nto be seen But when in the evening the ploughman came in to eat his meal  before\\r\\nhe began it he took the very best bit of meat and the nicest of the\\r\\nvegetable  and laid them down near the hole  Then he watched eagerly\\r\\nto see what would happen  but while he looked there they remained \\r\\nSuddenly  however  the door shut with a bang  and he turned his head\\r\\nfor a moment to see what caused it  and when he looked back the food\\r\\nhad disappeared  Every day it was much the same  He put some of the\\r\\nbest food on the table down near the hole  but as long as he watched\\r\\nthere it remained  but when he took his eyes off for a moment it had\\r\\ndisappeared  In the same way when he had new clothes  he took a choice\\r\\nbit of material and laid it near the hole  and it vanished also  And of\\r\\nwhatever came into the house he took some of the best and did the same\\r\\nwith it  Pg 215 Meantime things began to improve very much with him  He had only a\\r\\nlittle bit of land round his cottage  but this year the vegetables and\\r\\nfruit he had planted there grew so well that he had a large quantity to\\r\\nsend to market  and he sold them for such good prices  that soon he was\\r\\nable to get more land and buy his own animals  and in a little while\\r\\nhad a farm of his own  and had grown to be quite a rich man  while all\\r\\nhis neighbours said his luck was extraordinary  Meantime he saw or\\r\\nheard nothing more of the little black gnome  and except when he put\\r\\nthe food and other thing’s near the hole almost forgot all about her Time passed  and the time came when the ploughman began to think he\\r\\nwould like to take a wife  he made up his mind to marry a very pretty\\r\\ngirl in the next village  who was said to be the prettiest girl in all\\r\\nthe neighbourhood  Many of the young men would have liked to marry\\r\\nher  but the ploughman was a handsome  cheery young fellow  and she\\r\\npreferred him to all of the others  and so they were married  and she\\r\\ncame home to live at the farm  The evening after their wedding they had\\r\\na fine fat fowl for supper  and the ploughman before he helped his\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 216 \\r\\n\\r\\nwife cut off the choicest slice from the breast and took it as usual to\\r\\nthe hole “Husband ” cried the wife  “have you gone mad that you should give the\\r\\nbest of the food to the rats and the mice ”“I am not mad at all ” said the ploughman  “but my grandfather loved\\r\\nnothing in the world so well as rats and mice  and he made me promise\\r\\nbefore he died that they should always be well cared for in my house \\r\\nand have of the best ”“Then if you are not mad ” replied the wife  “I think your grandfather\\r\\nwas  It is only the best poison that is good for rats and mice \\r\\nand they shall have it soon  now that I am in the house ” But the\\r\\nploughman caressed his wife and begged her to let him keep his promise\\r\\nto his grandfather  and the wife held her peace  not liking to seem\\r\\nbad tempered on her wedding day  After a bit she got used to her\\r\\nhusband putting down little bits of food  as he said  for the rats and\\r\\nmice  and though she always declared she was going to poison them  she\\r\\ndid not try to do so  as her husband seemed grieved when she talked\\r\\nabout it  Pg 217 Thus things went on very happily for some months  when the wife began\\r\\nto think that her clothes were getting very old  and that she must\\r\\nhave some new ones  So she took plenty of money and went into the\\r\\nneighbouring town  and came home with new dresses  and hats  and\\r\\nbonnets  and very pretty she looked in them  and her husband was very\\r\\nmuch pleased with them  But that evening after his wife was gone\\r\\nto bed  as the ploughman was finishing his pipe in the kitchen  he\\r\\nsuddenly heard a deep voice from the hole  which called out just as it\\r\\nhad done months before  “Stop  I am coming up ”For an instant the ploughman quaked with fear  then he saw something no\\r\\nbigger than a black beetle creeping through the hole  and it came in\\r\\nfront of his chair  and he heard the voice  which was not so loud this\\r\\ntime  say—“That will do  now I am going to begin to grow a little ” and it began\\r\\nto grow  and grow  and grow  till it was about eight inches high  and\\r\\nthe ploughman saw it was the little black woman  “There ” she said \\r\\nspeaking quite quietly  “that is a nice useful size  that will do \\r\\nNow I have something to say to you  and you will have to attend very\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 218 \\r\\n\\r\\ncarefully  I consider that you are breaking your compact  In the first\\r\\nplace  you married without asking my leave  and  as I told you  I don’t\\r\\nlike women in the house  but I will say nothing about that  as we had\\r\\nnot spoken about it before  but how can you explain about all the fine\\r\\nclothes that your wife fetched home to day  She has taken them to her\\r\\nroom and not given one to me ”“Nay ” cried the ploughman  “they are my wife’s clothes  not mine ”“Nonsense ” said the gnome  “you gave her the money for them  Now\\r\\nunderstand that whatever she buys for herself in the future  she must\\r\\nbuy the same for me  Two of everything  dresses  hats  gloves  whatever\\r\\nshe has  I must have too  and be sure that mine are quite as good as\\r\\nhers ”“But how am I to manage that ” cried the ploughman  “how can I explain\\r\\nit to her without telling her that you are there ”“That is your business ” said the gnome  “All I say is that I must\\r\\nhave the things if I am to remain in your house  You can tell her what\\r\\nyou please  So now you know  and see that you do as I tell you ” and\\r\\nsuddenly the little figure shrunk up till it was about the size of a\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 219 \\r\\n\\r\\nblack beetle  and then disappeared down the hole without another word The ploughman rubbed his head  and wondered what he could do  He did\\r\\nnot at all want to tell his wife about the little gnome  for he was\\r\\nsure she would not like it  but at the same time he did not want the\\r\\ngnome to leave his house and take away his luck A few days after  his wife told him she was going to the shoemaker’s\\r\\nto buy herself some smart new shoes  and the ploughman thought of the\\r\\ngnome  and knew he must do as she had told him  So he said to his wife \\r\\n“Wife  when you get those shoes for yourself  I wish you would get a\\r\\npair just like them for my cousin who has written to me to ask me for a\\r\\npresent  I should like to send her some nice boots and shoes as she is\\r\\nvery poor  so I shall be very much obliged if you will get two pairs of\\r\\nwhatever you may get for yourself that I may send her one ”The wife wondered very much  for she did not know the ploughman had any\\r\\ncousin  however  she went into the town  and brought home two pairs of\\r\\nsmart red shoes with bows on the top  Pg 220 When she had gone to bed at night  the ploughman took one pair and\\r\\nlaid it by the hole in the same place where he had put the food  and\\r\\nit disappeared just as the food did without his seeing where it went \\r\\n“Now ” thought he  “when she sees I am quite honest  perhaps the ugly\\r\\nlittle gnome will be content  and let us go on in peace ”So time went on  and the ploughman and his wife lived very happily\\r\\nand quietly  till one evening a pedlar came round with a tray holding\\r\\nall sorts of pretty things to sell  The ploughman’s wife went to the\\r\\ndoor  and looked at the things  then she bought a pretty comb for her\\r\\nhair  but she would not show it to her husband  as she meant to wear it\\r\\nbefore him as a surprise next day But that evening after his wife had gone to bed  as the ploughman\\r\\nsat finishing his pipe by the fire  he heard the voice from the hole\\r\\ncalling as loudly as ever  “Stop  I am coming up ” Again the ploughman\\r\\nquaked with fear  and then he saw coming through the hole something no\\r\\nbigger than a black beetle  and again the voice said in a lower tone \\r\\n“Now I will begin to grow a little ” and presently the tiny black\\r\\nthing had swelled into the ugly little black woman with the face like\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 221 \\r\\n\\r\\nindia rubber “Listen to me ” she said  “and know that I am beginning to feel very\\r\\nangry  You are beginning to cheat me  To day your wife bought herself\\r\\na brand new comb from a pedlar at the door  and never got one for me \\r\\nTo morrow evening I must have that comb  I don’t care how you get it \\r\\nbut have it I must ”The ploughman scratched his head and was sore perplexed  “What on earth\\r\\nam I to do ” he cried  “for my wife will think me very cruel if I take\\r\\naway all the pretty little things she buys for herself ”“I can’t help that ” answered the gnome  “I have got to have that comb\\r\\nby this time to morrow night  and I warn you if you begin to deceive\\r\\nme  just as if I were an ordinary human being  I shall pretty soon take\\r\\nmyself off ” and with that the gnome disappeared through the hole in an\\r\\ninstant Next morning at breakfast the wife came down with the new comb in her\\r\\nhair  and said to her husband  “See  husband  I bought this of the\\r\\npedlar yesterday  and he tells me they are quite the newest fashion \\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 222 \\r\\n\\r\\nand all the great ladies in town are wearing them ”“Well ” quoth the ploughman  “such a fashion may be all very well for\\r\\nthe great ladies who have scarce any hair of their own  but  for my own\\r\\npart  I had rather see your beautiful hair just as it is without any\\r\\nadornment ”At this the wife pouted  and was very cross  “’Tis too bad of you\\r\\nto say that  I thought you would like your wife to wear all the new\\r\\nfashions  and be smart like other folks ”“Nay ” cried the ploughman  “my wife is much prettier than other folks \\r\\nand she looks prettiest of all when she has little to adorn her  If any\\r\\nof these great ladies had hair like yours you may be sure they would\\r\\npretty soon throw away any combs or caps or pins  so that nothing but\\r\\ntheir hair should be seen ”When her husband was gone  the wife went to her glass and looked at\\r\\nherself  and took out the comb and then put it in  and tried it every\\r\\nway  “’Tis true  for sure ” said she  “my hair is very beautiful  and\\r\\nmaybe it looks best done up as I used to wear it  still it seems a pity\\r\\nnot to use the comb when I have bought it ” So when her husband came\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 223 \\r\\n\\r\\nback  she said to him  “I believe you are right  husband  and it suits\\r\\nme better not to have anything in my hair  but maybe if you are wanting\\r\\nto send a present to that cousin of yours  you would like to send her\\r\\nthat comb  It would save buying anything fresh ”On this the ploughman laughed to himself  but he thanked his wife very\\r\\nmuch and put the comb in his pocket  In the evening after the wife had\\r\\ngone to bed  the ploughman took it  and put it down by the hole  and\\r\\nthen went on smoking his pipe without waiting to see if it disappeared \\r\\nBut in a few minutes he heard the voice crying  “Stop  I am coming up ”\\r\\nand saw again the gnome come through the hole and then begin to grow as\\r\\nbefore  “Now this is too bad ” cried the ploughman  “What can you want\\r\\nnow  Here I have just given you the comb you wanted  and nothing else\\r\\nnew has come into the house ” “On the contrary ” answered the gnome  “I\\r\\nconsider that you have brought a great many new things into the house\\r\\nsince I came to live here  and I mean now to have my choice of some of\\r\\nthem  since I do not find that you are honest enough to offer them to\\r\\nme  To begin with  I want your wife’s hair  I have been trying mine\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 224 \\r\\n\\r\\nwith that comb  and I find I can’t make it do at all  and so I mean to\\r\\nhave your wife’s ”“My wife’s ” gasped the ploughman  “You must be mad ”“Mad or not mad ” replied the gnome  “I mean to have it  and  moreover \\r\\nit is my due  You married without consulting me  and if I kept you to\\r\\nyour bargain  I should have a great deal that I have not got  Certainly\\r\\nyour wife has the best head of hair in the house  so you must cut it\\r\\noff near her head and bring it all to me ”“But whatever shall I say to my wife ” cried the ploughman in distress “That is your look out  not mine ” said the gnome  “Anyhow you have got\\r\\nto give it to me  But as the thought of it seems to annoy you I will\\r\\ngive you a week to get it in ”The ploughman sat and thought and thought  and very sad did he feel\\r\\nat thinking of all his wife’s beautiful hair being given away to the\\r\\nlittle gnome Next day he took his horse and cart  and told his wife he had to go for\\r\\na long drive on business to a big town  a long way off  It was quite\\r\\nthe biggest town in that neighbourhood  and many very fine people\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 225 \\r\\n\\r\\nlived there  At first the wife wanted to go too  but her husband said\\r\\nit was too far and she would be too tired  as he could not be back till\\r\\nvery late at night Next morning  when they sat at breakfast  he told his wife all he had\\r\\nheard and seen in the big town  and then he added  “And all the very\\r\\nfine ladies there have now the funniest fashion ”“And what is that ” asked his wife  “pray tell me  for I love to hear\\r\\nthe new fashions ”“Why ” said the ploughman  “’tis with their hair  Instead of wearing it\\r\\nlong  they have it cut quite close all round their heads  because they\\r\\nsay it looks smarter now ”“Well  I do call that a silly fashion ” said the wife  “they can’t have\\r\\nhad much hair to consent to have had it cut off ”“No  indeed ” said her husband  “and yet with some of them  they look\\r\\nvery smart and pretty with their little curly heads ”“Much like boys  I should think ” said the wife scornfully “No  not quite that  either ” said the ploughman  “more like the\\r\\npictures of angels in the old churches  and they say it is the great\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 226 \\r\\n\\r\\nthing for it to curl up all round the head  and when it does that of\\r\\nitself  they are very proud of it ”“Well  then  some of them might be very proud of mine ” said the wife \\r\\n“for it’s as curly as may be  and if I were to cut it short would be\\r\\nall in tiny curls ”When her husband had gone to his work  the ploughman’s wife could do\\r\\nnothing but think of the strange new fashion of which her husband had\\r\\ntold her  “I wonder how it would suit me ” she thought  and when he\\r\\ncame in to dinner she said to him—“Husband  is it really true that all those fine ladies looked very\\r\\npretty and smart with their hair short ”“Ay  that they did ” he said  “I was quite surprised to see them  and\\r\\nI heard they said ’twas a wonderful saving of trouble  and that their\\r\\nhair could never grow untidy ”“That is true ” said the wife  “yet I should be sorry to cut mine off ” Pg 227 8 \\n“No need that you should ” said the ploughman  “and there are not many\\r\\nfolks up here to see if we are in the fashion or not  All the same \\r\\nyou are sure to look prettier than the town ladies any way  whichever\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 229 \\r\\n\\r\\nway your hair is done  for your face is prettier ”But when her husband had gone away again the wife went to her glass\\r\\nwith the scissors in her hand  “As my husband says ” she quoth  “it\\r\\nwould be a wonderful saving of trouble  and then it would be very nice\\r\\nto let all the women round see that I could be in the fashion before\\r\\nthey  I wonder how it would look ” and she snipped off a big bit  “Here\\r\\ngoes ” she cried  “after all ’tis best to follow the fashions  whatever\\r\\nthey are ” and she went on cutting till  when her husband came in  he\\r\\nfound her with her hair all cut off beside her “There  husband ” cried she  “do I look like the smart ladies in town ”“Ay  that you do ” he answered  “only ten times prettier  but as for\\r\\nall that beautiful hair  you must just give it to me  for it is so\\r\\nbeautiful I would not let it be lost for anything ” and he took up all\\r\\nthe heap of fine gold hair and tied it together with a bright ribbon The wife looked at herself in the glass  and thought she really looked\\r\\nvery nice with little curls all round her head  and though the\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 230 \\r\\n\\r\\nploughman grieved over it in his heart  yet he was glad he had got her\\r\\nhair  and thought  “Now at last that miserable little gnome will be\\r\\ncontent  and leave me alone ” So that evening  when his wife was gone\\r\\nto bed  he took the bunch of hair and laid it near the hole  and it\\r\\ndisappeared  and he knew the gnome had it So for a time all went on quietly with the ploughman  and he hoped he\\r\\nshould not hear more of the gnome  but one evening  after his wife had\\r\\ngone to bed and he was in the kitchen smoking his pipe alone  he heard\\r\\nthe hated voice shouting  “Stop  I am coming up ” and then he saw the\\r\\nlittle black thing like a black beetle coming through the hole  and all\\r\\nhappened just as before “Well  what do you want now ” cried the ploughman when he saw the ugly\\r\\nlittle woman in front of him  “I have given you my wife’s hair  and\\r\\nsurely you ought to be content ”“Not at all ” said the gnome  “for I have tried on her hair  and I find\\r\\nit does not suit my complexion  I have never seen her myself  and I\\r\\ndon’t think you any judge  but I heard you telling her that her face\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 231 \\r\\n\\r\\nwas prettier than any of the town ladies  In that case you have no\\r\\nright to keep it for yourself  I must have your wife’s face ”“My wife’s face ” screamed the ploughman  “I think you must be mad  How\\r\\ncan I give you my wife’s face  And what would you do with it ”“Wear it ” answered the gnome  “and all you have to do is to fetch your\\r\\nwife in here this day week  and tell her what I wish  and I will come\\r\\nup and scrape off as much of her face as I want ”“Why  it would kill her ” cried the ploughman “Not at all ” said the gnome  “neither would it hurt her  for she would\\r\\nscarcely feel my little knife  the only thing is  that when I have\\r\\ndone  her skin will be rather black and shrivelled like my own  but as\\r\\nmine has been good enough for me all these years  it will surely be\\r\\ngood enough for a common human woman  Anyhow  now you know  I must have\\r\\nyour wife’s complexion to wear with her hair  or else I go at once  And\\r\\nas it will be you who have broken the compact  I shall take all your\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 232 \\r\\n\\r\\nwealth with me ” And repeating in a deep voice  “Remember  this day\\r\\nweek at twelve o’clock ” the gnome grew small  and disappeared through\\r\\nthe hole Next day the ploughman was very miserable  and whenever he looked at\\r\\nhis wife felt inclined to burst into tears  The wife  not knowing what\\r\\nwas amiss  tried to cheer him  and asked if he were ill  But he shook\\r\\nhis head  and told her “no ” and had not the courage to tell her the\\r\\ntruth  Thus things went on  the ploughman growing sadder and sadder\\r\\nevery day  till the evening before that on which the gnome had told him\\r\\nhe must bring his wife to meet her  The ploughman was scarce able to\\r\\ncheck his sobs before his wife  and at last she came into the kitchen \\r\\nand there found him crying outright When she saw this  she kneeled down by him  and said  “Husband  you\\r\\nsurely do not think me a good wife  for a good wife shares all her\\r\\nhusband’s troubles  Tell me what troubles you  Two heads are better\\r\\nthan one  and perhaps I can help you ”Then the ploughman told her all about the hated gnome  and how he had\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 233 \\r\\n\\r\\nfound it in a field  and how he had promised to give it some of the\\r\\nbest of everything  and now how it wanted her face At first the wife would scarcely believe it  and then she cried  “But\\r\\nif ’tis such a little creature why not pick it up and strangle it  or\\r\\nlet me put my foot on it  while it is no bigger than a black beetle ”“Nay  do not think of such a thing ” said her husband  “for it is ill\\r\\nto play tricks with fairy folk  and most likely she would kill us\\r\\noutright ”“But part with my face I never will ” cried the wife “Then we will let her go and take with her the house and all our\\r\\nwealth  and be contented to live in my old cottage again  and be quite\\r\\npoor folk ” said her husband On hearing this the wife burst into tears  and wept more bitterly than\\r\\nher husband  for she would not stop at all  It was in vain for him to\\r\\ntry to cheer her and tell her that poor folk could be quite as happy\\r\\nas rich ones  She declared she could never be happy poor  Then when\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 234 \\r\\n\\r\\nhe said if she would let her face go  he would love her just as much\\r\\nor more without it  she cried that she could never be happy with a\\r\\ndreadful shrivelled black skin like a monkey’s  All that night she\\r\\ncried  and when morning came her skin was all red  and her eyes could\\r\\nscarce be seen  so swelled were their lids  but still she cried on all\\r\\nday  and her husband said nothing to comfort her  because he did not\\r\\nknow what to say  By the time it grew dark  her face was so swelled and\\r\\nsore that she could not bear to touch it  and she had cried herself\\r\\nalmost blind  but still the tears were rolling down  When the time came\\r\\nfor the clock to strike twelve  her husband took her hand and led her\\r\\nto the kitchen  and there she sat with her face in her hands sobbing \\r\\nJust as the clock struck  they heard the voice like thunder shouting \\r\\n“Stop  I am coming up ” and the wife peeped between her fingers and\\r\\nsaw the little thing no bigger than a black beetle come through the\\r\\nhole and then grow  and grow  and grow  till it was like an ugly little\\r\\nblack woman near a foot high  And when she saw how hideous it was she\\r\\n\\r\\n Pg 235 \\r\\n\\r\\nthought  “Never  never will I consent to have a skin like that—not for\\r\\nmillions of pounds ”The gnome did not speak to her  but said to the ploughman  “So you have\\r\\nbrought your wife  That is a good thing  if you wish me to remain with\\r\\nyou  So now tell her to take down her hands and let me see this face\\r\\nyou make such a fuss about  I have my knife all ready ”And the ploughman saw that she had in her hand a tiny knife  which did\\r\\nnot look as if it could hurt any one “Wife  wife ” groaned the ploughman  “what shall we do ”Then the wife looked up out of her swollen eyes  and was just going to\\r\\nspeak  when the gnome gave a shriek  “What ” she cried  “that face  Do\\r\\nyou mean to say that is what you think so pretty  and that I am going\\r\\nto change my beautiful  dry  black skin for that swollen red mass  No \\r\\nindeed  You must be mad  It is a good thing that I saw it in time  I\\r\\nshall leave the house at once ”“Nay ” cried the ploughman  “but it is you who are breaking your\\r\\ncompact this time ” Pg 236 But the gnome made no reply  but scuttled down through the hole as fast\\r\\nas it could  and the ploughman and his wife burst out laughing for joy \\r\\nAnd that was the last they ever saw of it  and it must have gone right\\r\\naway  but they knew it had left some of its luck behind it  as they\\r\\nboth lived happily for the rest of their days THE END\\nRichard Clay   Sons  Limited  London   Bungay \\nSYLVIA IN\\r\\nFLOWERLAND  By Linda Gardiner  With\\r\\nSixteen Illustrations by

once a\\r\\nwindmill which stood on the downs by the sea  far from any town or\\r\\nvillage  and in which the miller lived alone with his little daughter \\r\\nhis wife had died when the little girl  whose name was lucilla  was a\\r\\nbaby  and so the miller lived by himself with his child  of whom he was\\r\\nvery proud  as her father was busy with his work  and as little lucilla\\r\\nhad no other children to play with  she was alone nearly all day \\r\\nand had to amuse herself as best she could  and one of her greatest\\r\\npleasures was to sit and watch the great sails of the windmill figures like them  and they\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 4 \\r\\n\\r\\nheld each other by the hand  and were dancing and springing from the\\r\\nground as lightly as if they had been made of feather down “come  sisters  come ” cried the one nearest lucilla  “see  here is a\\r\\nlittle human child out here alone at twelve o’clock at night  come and\\r\\nlet us play with her ”“who are you ” asked lucilla  “my name is lucilla  and i live in the\\r\\nmill with my father ”“we are windfairies ” said the first grey figure “windfairies ” said lucilla  “what are they ”“we blow the winds and sweep the earth  when there are many of us\\r\\ntogether we make a great hurricane  and human beings are frightened  we\\r\\nit is who turn your mill wheel for you  and make all the little waves\\r\\non the sea  see  if you will come with us we will take you for a ride\\r\\non one of the sails of your mill  that is  if you will be brave  and\\r\\nnot cry ”“i will not cry one bit ” said lucilla  and she sprang up  and held out\\r\\nher arms at once she was lifted up  and felt herself going higher and higher \\r\\n\\r\\n pg 5 \\r\\n\\r\\ntill she rested on one of the great windmill sails  and  with the\\r\\nlittle grey elves beside her  was sweeping through the air  clinging to\\r\\nthe sail “she is quite good ” whispered one  as she held lucilla in her tiny\\r\\nwhite arms  “i really think we might teach her to dance  for she has\\r\\nnot cried at all ”“no  she would surely tell some one if we did ” said another  “little\\r\\nhuman child  would you like us to teach you how to dance as we dance ”“yes  yes ” cried lucilla  and now they were sweeping down near the\\r\\nground  and the fairies slid off the sail with lucilla in their arms \\r\\nand let her slide gently to earth  “teach me to dance  i beg  i will\\r\\nnever tell anybody ”“ah  but that is what all mortals say ” whispered one who had not\\r\\nspoken yet  “no mortal can keep a secret  never yet was one known who\\r\\ncould be silent ”“try me ” cried lucilla again  “i will never tell  indeed i will not ”\\r\\nand she looked entreatingly from one to another of the elves “but if you did ” said they  “if you broke your promise to us when\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 6 \\r\\n\\r\\nonce you had made it  we should punish you severely ”“but i promise faithfully ” repeated lucilla  “i will never tell any\\r\\none ”“well then  you may try ” they said  “only remember  if you break\\r\\nyour word to us  and tell any mortal who it was that taught you how\\r\\nto dance  you will never dance again  for your feet will become heavy\\r\\nas lead  and not only that  but some great misfortune will overtake\\r\\nwhatever you love best in this world  but if you keep faith with us \\r\\nthen the windfairies will never forget you  but will come to your help\\r\\nin your direst hour of need ”“teach me  teach me ” cried lucilla  “indeed i will never  never tell \\r\\nand i long to dance as you do ”“come then ” they said  and some came behind her  and some went in\\r\\nfront of her  and some took her arms and some her feet  and all at\\r\\nonce lucilla felt as if she were made of feather down  she swayed up\\r\\nand down as lightly as they  and it seemed to her quite easy  never\\r\\nhad she been so happy  and she would gladly have danced for hours  but\\r\\nsuddenly  just as the sun was beginning to show a red light in the\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 7 \\r\\n\\r\\nsky  she heard her father’s horse galloping over the downs  and in an\\r\\ninstant the windfairies had vanished when the miller came up to her  he was angry with her for being out on\\r\\nthe grass instead of warm in bed  but lucilla dared not tell him what\\r\\nhad kept her  or say that she had been playing with windfairies years passed  and lucilla never saw the windfairies again  though she\\r\\nwatched for them every night  she grew up to be a beautiful young\\r\\nwoman  and her father was very proud of her  she was as tall and as\\r\\nlithe as a willow wand  and when she ran or danced it seemed as if she\\r\\nwere as light as a feather blown in the wind  there were few people\\r\\nto see her  or tell her she was beautiful  for save the fisher folk\\r\\nwho lived in little cottages on the beach  scarce anybody came to the\\r\\ndowns  but all who saw her admired her beauty  and most of all her\\r\\nwonderful dancing  sometimes she would go out on the downs  and dance\\r\\nand run there by herself  and her father would look at her and say \\r\\n“heaven help the maid  i don’t know whom she has learned it from  but\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 8 \\r\\n\\r\\ni have never seen a dancer who can come nigh her ” then sometimes she\\r\\nwould go down to the sea shore  and this she loved to do best of all \\r\\nand there she would dance with the waves  and move with them as they\\r\\nslid up to her feet and drew back  and to those who watched  it seemed\\r\\nas if she and they were one together the time came when her father wished her to be married  and among the\\r\\nyoung fishermen and the country folk who came to the mill from the\\r\\nfarms across the country  she had suitors enough  but always she said\\r\\nwhen a young man came to woo her  “first let me see how you can dance \\r\\nfor as dancing is the thing i love best in the world  it would be a\\r\\npity that i and my husband should not be able to dance together ” and\\r\\nas none of them could dance as she did  she sent them all away  saying\\r\\nshe would wait for a husband till she could find a man who could dance\\r\\nto her liking but one day there was a great storm  and a big ship was blown on to\\r\\nthe shore close to the mill  and among the sailors was a young fellow\\r\\nwith black curly hair and bright eyes and white teeth  and when he saw\\r\\nlucilla  he said to himself  “i will wed that girl and take her home\\r\\nfor my wife ” so one day as they sat on the downs together he begged\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nher to marry him  and go back with him to his own land  he said he\\r\\nwould give up going to sea  and would live with her in a little cottage\\r\\nand make their bread by fishing  then lucilla said  as she had said\\r\\nto all her other suitors  “first let me see how you can dance  for i\\r\\nwill never marry any man who cannot dance with me ” the sailor swore he\\r\\ncould dance as well as any man in the world  for all sailors can dance \\r\\nhe said  and they began to dance together on the downs  the sailor\\r\\ndanced well and merrily  but lucilla danced faster  and seemed as if\\r\\nshe were made of feather down  and then the sailor  seeing that his\\r\\ndancing was as nothing to hers  caught her by the waist  and held her\\r\\nstill  crying  “my sweetheart  i cannot dance as you can  but my arms\\r\\nare strong enough to hold you still and keep you from dancing with any\\r\\nman but me ”so lucilla married the sailor  and went with him to live in his little\\r\\ncottage by the sea  many miles away from the mill  and as her father\\r\\nwas growing old and no longer cared to work  he went with her too  pg 10 for some time the sailor and lucilla lived together very happily  and\\r\\nthey had two little children  and her husband fished and sold his fish \\r\\nand often still  lucilla would go down to the waves and dance with them\\r\\nas she had done in her old home  she tried to teach her little children\\r\\nto dance as she did  but they could not learn because the windfairies\\r\\nhad never touched them  but one winter her husband’s boat was dashed to\\r\\npieces  and the sea froze so that all the fish died  and they became so\\r\\npoor that they could barely get enough to eat  then it chanced that a\\r\\nbig ship came to the village where they lived  and the captain wanted\\r\\nmen for a long journey  and her husband told lucilla that he had best\\r\\ngo with him  and then he would have enough money to buy another boat \\r\\nand then next year they must hope for better luck  so lucilla was left\\r\\nalone in the cottage with her father and her two little children  and\\r\\nshe felt very lonely and sad without her husband  and often she thought\\r\\nof the mill and the windfairies  and when the wind blew  she would go\\r\\ndown to the water’s edge and hold out her arms and pray them to take\\r\\ncare of her husband’s ship  and bring it safe home again  pg 11 “oh  kind windfairies ” she cried  “see  i have kept faith with you  so\\r\\ndo you now keep faith with me  and do me no hurt ” and often she would\\r\\ndance by the edge of the waves  as she used to do in her old home  and\\r\\nthink that the windfairies were dancing with her  and holding up her\\r\\nsteps now it chanced that one day  as lucilla was dancing on the shore  there\\r\\nrode by two horsemen  and they stopped and watched her as she danced \\r\\nwith the waves coming close to her feet  then they got down from their\\r\\nhorses  and asked who she was  and where she had learned such dancing \\r\\nshe told them she was only the wife of a poor fisherman  but she had\\r\\ndanced for long years  since she was a little child  when she had lived\\r\\nin a windmill  on the downs far away  they rode away  but next day they\\r\\ncame again  and brought others with them  and begged lucilla that she\\r\\nwould go down to the water’s edge and dance with the waves as she had\\r\\ndone yesterday  so she ran down the beach  and danced in time to the\\r\\nsea as it moved  and the strangers all applauded  and said to each\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 12 \\r\\n\\r\\nother  “it is wonderful  it is marvellous ”they then told her that they came from a country where the king loved\\r\\nnothing so much as beautiful dancing  and that he would give great sums\\r\\nof money to any one who danced well  and if she would go back with them\\r\\nto his court  and dance before the king  she should have a sack of gold\\r\\nto take home with her  and this would make her a rich woman  and her\\r\\nhusband would never have need to work any more at first she refused  and said her husband was away  and would not\\r\\nknow where she was gone  and she did not like to leave her two little\\r\\nchildren  but still the courtiers persuaded her  and said it would not\\r\\nbe for long  and her father persuaded her too  since he said it would\\r\\nmake them all rich if she brought home a sack of gold  so at last\\r\\nlucilla agreed that she would go back with them to the king’s court\\r\\nand dance there  but she made them promise that before the spring came\\r\\nthey would send her back to her own little cottage  on hearing this \\r\\nthe strangers were much delighted  and bid lucilla make ready to start\\r\\nat once  and that night she said good bye to her little ones  and\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 13 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nleft them  to go with the travellers  her eyes were red with crying at\\r\\nleaving her home  and before she started  she went out alone on to the\\r\\ncliffs  and stretched out her arms  and called to the windfairies to go\\r\\nwith her and help her  for she feared what she was going to do  and she\\r\\nbegged them to be true to her  as she had been true to them they sailed for many days  till at last they came to a country of which\\r\\nlucilla had never even heard  and to a big town  which seemed to her\\r\\nas if it must hold all the people in the world  so crowded was it  and\\r\\nabove the town on the hill  they pointed out to her a royal palace  and\\r\\ntold her it was where the king dwelt  and there she would have to dance\\r\\nere the week was out “and it is most lucky we saw you just now ” said they  “for the king is\\r\\njust going to be married  and in a few days the princess will arrive \\r\\nand there will be festivities and rejoicing for days  and at some of\\r\\nthese you will appear before their majesties  and be sure you dance\\r\\nyour very best ”then lucilla went with them into a great hall close to the palace \\r\\nwhere musicians were playing on every kind of instrument  and here the\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 14 \\r\\n\\r\\ncourtiers bid her dance on a platform at one end of the hall  in time\\r\\nto the music  and when they had seen it  the musicians one and all lay\\r\\ndown their instruments  and rose together  clapping and applauding  and\\r\\nall declared that it was the greatest of luck that the travellers had\\r\\nmet with lucilla  and that it would delight the king more than anything\\r\\nthey had prepared for him by and by the princess who was to marry the king arrived  and the\\r\\nwedding was celebrated with much magnificence  and after the wedding\\r\\nthere was a feast  and in the evening there was to be singing and\\r\\ndancing  and all sorts of play for the royal couple and the court to\\r\\nsee  and then lucilla was to dance  the courtier who brought her wished\\r\\nher to be dressed in the most gorgeous dress  with gold and jewels  but\\r\\nshe pleaded that she might wear a light grey gown like the windfairies \\r\\nbecause she remembered how they looked when they danced on the downs when the evening came when she was to dance before the king  she threw\\r\\nwide her window and held out her arms  and cried out  “now help me \\r\\ndear windfairies  as you have done before  keep faith with me  as i\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 15 \\r\\n\\r\\nhave kept faith with you ” but in truth she could scarce keep from\\r\\ncrying with thoughts of her husband at sea  and her little ones at the\\r\\ncottage at home the hall was brilliantly lighted  and in the middle on the throne sat\\r\\nthe king and the young queen  the musicians began to play  and then\\r\\nlucilla stepped forth on the platform and began to dance  she felt as\\r\\nlight as the sea foam  and when she swayed and curved to the sound of\\r\\nthe music  it seemed to her as if she heard only the swish of the waves\\r\\nas they beat upon the shore  and the murmur of the wind as it played\\r\\nwith the water  and she thought of her husband out at sea  with the\\r\\nwind blowing his ship along  and of her little babies living in the\\r\\ncottage on the beach when she stopped  there was such a noise of applauding and cheering in\\r\\nthe hall  as had never been heard there before  and the king sent for\\r\\nher  and asked her where she came from  and who had taught her such\\r\\nwonderful steps  but she only answered that she was the daughter of a\\r\\npoor miller  who lived in a windmill  and she thought she must have\\r\\nlearnt to dance from watching the windmill’s sails go round  every\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 16 \\r\\n\\r\\nnight the king would have her dance again and again  as he never tired\\r\\nof watching her  and every night lucilla said to herself  “now another\\r\\nnight is gone  and i am one day nearer to their taking me back to my\\r\\nown home and my children  with a bag of gold to give to my husband when\\r\\nhe comes back from sea ”the new queen was a handsome woman  but she was very jealous  and it\\r\\nmade her angry that the king should admire the new dancer’s dancing so\\r\\nmuch  and she thought she would like to be able to dance like her  so\\r\\none evening when no one was watching her  she put on a big cloak that\\r\\ncovered her all over  and asked her way to where the dancer lived \\r\\nlucilla sat alone in the little house that they had given her to live\\r\\nin  and the queen came in behind her  and took off her cloak  and\\r\\nbade her be silent and not say her name  for fear some one should be\\r\\nlistening and know that she was there “now ” she said  “i have come to you that you may tell me  though no\\r\\none else knows it  who taught you to dance  that i may go and learn\\r\\nfrom them also to dance like you  for in the home that i come from  i\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 17 \\r\\n\\r\\nwas said to be the most graceful woman in the land and the best dancer \\r\\nso that there is no dancing that i cannot learn ”lucilla trembled  but she answered “your majesty  i lived in a little windmill by the sea when i was a\\r\\nchild  far from teachers or dancers  but i watched the windmill sails\\r\\ngo round  morn  noon  and night  and perhaps it is that that taught me\\r\\nto dance as i do now  and if your majesty wishes to learn to do what\\r\\ni do  i will gladly teach you all i know  and doubtless you will soon\\r\\nlearn to dance far better than i ”upon this the queen was delighted  and flung aside her cloak  and stood\\r\\nopposite to lucilla  and begged her to begin to teach her at once  that\\r\\nshe might learn as soon as possible  all that evening they danced  but\\r\\nwhen the queen thought she looked just as lucilla did  she appeared to\\r\\nbe quite awkward and heavy beside her  and was dancing just as other\\r\\nmortals might  when she went away she was very much pleased  and said\\r\\nthat she would come twice more to learn from her  and then she was\\r\\nsure that she would be perfect  in her heart lucilla was very much\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 18 \\r\\n\\r\\nfrightened  because she knew that the queen did not dance as she did \\r\\nand never could  however  the next night she came again  and the next\\r\\nagain  and then there was to be a grand court ball  and at this the\\r\\nqueen thought she would first show her husband how she could dance \\r\\nthe king himself was fond of dancing  and danced well  although not\\r\\nhalf so well as lucilla’s husband the sailor  and the queen thought\\r\\nhow delighted he would be when he saw what a graceful wife he had got \\r\\nas the ball began  all the fine people were saying to each other  it\\r\\nreally seemed silly to dance after they had seen the wonderful new\\r\\ndancer  but the queen smiled and thought to herself  “now they will see\\r\\nthat i can do quite as well as she ” when her turn came she tripped\\r\\nlightly forward and danced as best she could  and thought it was just\\r\\nlike lucilla  and the courtiers said among each other  “our new queen\\r\\ndances well ” but no one thought of saying that it was like lucilla’s\\r\\ndancing  and the king said nothing at all on the matter  therefore the\\r\\nqueen felt herself growing hot and angry  and she turned red and white\\r\\nby turns  pg 19 “that lying wench has been tricking me ” she said to herself  “and\\r\\nshe has not taught me right at all  but i will punish her for her\\r\\ndeception  and soon she shall know what it is to deceive a queen ”so the next day she went to her husband and said  “husband  i have\\r\\nthought much of the new wonderful dancer whom we all admire so much \\r\\nand truly i have never seen any one on earth who could dance as she\\r\\ncan  but now i think we should do well before she goes back to her own\\r\\nhome to know who has taught her her marvellous art  so that we may have\\r\\nour court dancers taught  that they may be there to please us when she\\r\\nis gone  for really there is nothing on earth that cannot be learnt if\\r\\nit is taught in the right way ”the king agreed  and they sent for lucilla  and the king asked her to\\r\\ntell him where she had learnt her dancing  that they might summon the\\r\\nsame teachers to teach their court dancers  but lucilla answered as\\r\\nbefore—she did not know—she thought she must have learnt dancing from\\r\\nwatching the windmill sails going round  at this the king became angry \\r\\nand said  “that is nonsense  no one could learn dancing from looking\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 20 \\r\\n\\r\\nat windmill sails  neither was it possible that she  a poor miller’s\\r\\ndaughter  could have learnt such dancing by nature ” then he threatened\\r\\nher  that if she would not tell him the truth he should be obliged to\\r\\npunish her  and he said she should have a day to think of it in  but at\\r\\nthe end of the next day  he should expect her to tell him everything he\\r\\nwanted to know quite plainly when she was gone away the king said to the queen  “wife  if this\\r\\ndancer persists in her silence  and will not tell us how she has\\r\\nlearnt  there is another thing which we must do  we must keep her here\\r\\nto dance for us as much as we choose  and not let her return at all to\\r\\nthe home from which she came ”the queen was silent for a little  but she felt very jealous at the\\r\\nthought of the dancer remaining at the court  so she nodded her head\\r\\nand said  “yes  but i think she ought to tell us more about it  for\\r\\nmyself  i begin to think that it is witchcraft  and perhaps she has\\r\\nbeen taught by the evil one  and then we shouldn’t like her to remain\\r\\nhere and dance to us however beautiful it be  for who knows what ill\\r\\nluck it might not bring upon us ” upon this the king looked grave  and\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 21 \\r\\n\\r\\nsaid he did not believe much in ill luck or good luck  but he should be\\r\\nloth to lose the dancer  so they had better settle to keep her if she\\r\\ndeclined to tell them how the other dancers were to be taught meantime lucilla went back to her little house  and wept bitterly \\r\\n“would that i had never left my babes and my home ” she cried  “for i\\r\\ncannot break my word to the windfairies  and if i did they might do\\r\\nsome terrible harm to my little ones or to my husband at sea  yet if i\\r\\nrefuse to tell them they will most likely put me into prison  and there\\r\\ni shall remain for my life  and my husband and children will never\\r\\nknow what has become of me ” and she knelt down before the windows and\\r\\nlifted her arms and cried out  “oh  dear windfairies  i have not broken\\r\\nfaith with you  so don’t break faith with me  and come to my help and\\r\\nsave me in my trouble ”next evening lucilla went again before the king  and he said to her \\r\\n“well  now will you tell us what we asked you last night  so that we\\r\\nmay send for your teachers  and have others taught to dance as you do ” pg 22 “my gracious liege ” answered lucilla  “i can tell you nothing that i\\r\\nhave not told you before  since i was a child i have danced as i dance\\r\\nnow  and i watched the sails of my father’s windmill  and i danced in\\r\\ntime to the waves  and perhaps that is what taught me to keep time and\\r\\nstep so well  i was dancing by the sea shore when the travellers who\\r\\nbrought me here found me  and they promised me a bag of gold to take\\r\\nhome to my husband if i would come and dance at your majesty’s court \\r\\nand now you have seen me dance  and i have done all i can do  so i\\r\\nentreat you to give me the bag of gold  and let me go home again ”the king was silent  but the queen was still more angry  and in her\\r\\nheart was determined that lucilla should never return to her home until\\r\\nshe had found out about her dancing  so when they were alone she said\\r\\nto her husband  “it is now quite clear  it is by witchcraft that this\\r\\nwoman has learned  and we should do very wrong if we let her go till\\r\\nshe has confessed all ” so again they sent for lucilla and ordered her\\r\\nto confess  and again she wept and declared that she could tell no\\r\\nmore  then the king said  “well  let us give the woman her bag of gold\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 23 \\r\\n\\r\\nand let her go ” but the queen stopped him  and said  “no indeed  let\\r\\nus first try shutting her up in prison for a bit  and see if that won’t\\r\\nopen her lips ”at first the king refused  for he said that lucilla had done no wrong \\r\\nbut the queen insisted that she was deceiving them  and that her\\r\\ndancing must be witchcraft  and at last the king began to listen to\\r\\nher  also he was very angry with lucilla for wanting to go home  and\\r\\nmuch disappointed to think he should see her dancing no more  so he\\r\\nconsented  and said that either she must tell him how it was she came\\r\\nto be able to dance better than anybody else in this world  and who\\r\\ntaught her  or else they should think her dancing witchcraft  and she\\r\\nmust go to prison and wait her punishment poor lucilla wept most bitterly  “alas ” cried she to herself  “woe is\\r\\nme  for i dare not break faith with the windfairies  and yet if i do\\r\\nnot  i shall never see my husband or my babies again  for i fear lest\\r\\nthey may put me to death here ” pg 24 however  she continued to be silent  and the king ordered her to be\\r\\nput into prison until she should speak out and tell them the truth \\r\\nand the guards came and led her away to prison  and locked her into a\\r\\ndark cell  it was dreary and cold  and the walls were so thick that\\r\\nshe could not hear any of the noises from without  and there was only\\r\\none little window  which was too high up for her to see through  here\\r\\nshe lay and lamented  and almost wished she could die at once  for she\\r\\nbelieved that they would burn her  or drown her  and bitterly did she\\r\\ngrieve that she had left her home and her children every day the king sent down to ask if she had changed her mind  but\\r\\nevery day she answered that she had nothing to say  one evening she sat\\r\\nin her dark cell alone  grieving as usual  when the prison door opened \\r\\nand there entered a woman wrapped in a cloak and with her face hidden\\r\\nby a mask  when she took off the mask lucilla saw it was the queen  and\\r\\nshe sprang up hoping that she had come to tell her that she was to be\\r\\nreleased  but the queen said  “now i have come to you alone that you\\r\\nmay tell me the truth  who taught you to dance  and where can i learn\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 25 \\r\\n\\r\\nto do what you do  if you will tell me i will ask the king to forgive\\r\\nyou  and you shall have your bag of gold  and go when you like ”then poor lucilla began to cry afresh  and said  “my gracious lady \\r\\ni can tell you one thing that i have not yet told to any one  that\\r\\nis  that i did learn my dancing  but who told me  or how it was  is a\\r\\nsecret that i swore i would never tell to any one  and now i implore\\r\\nyour royal highness to let me go back to my fisherman husband  and my\\r\\nbabies  alack  alack  it was an evil hour for me when i left my home ”upon this the queen became furious  but she hid her anger  and first\\r\\nshe tried to coax lucilla to confess all  then she threatened her\\r\\nwith the king’s wrath  and then  as lucilla still wept and said that\\r\\nshe could not break her promise  she started up in a rage  and said \\r\\n“indeed  it is of little use  however much you love your husband and\\r\\nyour children  for you will never see them again  the king has settled\\r\\nthat you shall be killed this very week  so now you know what you have\\r\\ngained by your wicked obstinacy ” pg 26 so the queen returned to the king  and told him that the dancer had\\r\\nconfessed that she had learned her dancing  but she would not say from\\r\\nwhom  therefore it must be from the evil one  and therefore there was\\r\\nnothing for it but that she should be killed  so they settled that\\r\\nfirst they would try to drown lucilla  and if she were a witch she\\r\\nwould not sink  and the king gave orders that she should be taken out\\r\\nto sea next day and thrown overboard  and also that she should have\\r\\nheavy weights tied to her feet  and her arms should be bound to her\\r\\nsides next morning the guards fetched her  and they bound her arms to her\\r\\nsides  and tied heavy weights to her feet  and they took her down and\\r\\nplaced her in a boat on the sea shore  and they rowed her out to sea \\r\\nand all along the beach stood crowds of people  shouting and jeering \\r\\nand calling out  “she is a witch  she is a witch  the king has done\\r\\nwell to have her killed ”“alas  alas ” cried lucilla  “what have i done to deserve this  surely\\r\\ni have done no wrong to be so cruelly treated  dear windfairies  come\\r\\nto my help  for in truth now is the time of my direst need  and if you\\r\\ndesert me i am lost  but i pray you keep faith with me  as i have\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 27 \\r\\n\\r\\nkept faith with you ” then  when they had rowed the boat out a little\\r\\nway  the guards seized her  and threw her into the water  and the salt\\r\\nwaves splashed over her face and through her hair  but in spite of the\\r\\nheavy weights on her feet she never sank  but felt as light as when she\\r\\ndanced with the waves on the sea shore by her home  and she knew that\\r\\nthe windfairies held her up  and the waves rocked her gently  and drew\\r\\nher in towards the land  and laid her on the sand  and all the crowd\\r\\nyelled with rage when they found that lucilla could not be drowned both the king and\\r\\nqueen were very angry  and said that now it was quite clear that she\\r\\nwas a witch  and that she must be burnt  so they must take her back to\\r\\nprison  and arrange for her to be burnt in the market place  so lucilla\\r\\nwas again taken back to her little dark cell  and she kneeled on the\\r\\nground and looked up to the window  and murmured  “thank you  dear\\r\\nwindfairies  you have kept faith with me  as i have kept faith with\\r\\nyou ”then again the guards came  and took her by the arms and led her to\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 28 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe market place  and here she saw a great pile of wood made  whereon\\r\\nshe was to be laid  and already men were busy setting fire to it \\r\\nbut as lucilla and the guards came to the spot  there arose a little\\r\\nbreeze  and it blew on to the faces of the crowd who went to see her\\r\\nburnt  the men who were trying to light the pile of wood  said they\\r\\ncould not make it catch for the wind  when at last it did catch fire \\r\\nthe flames would not rise in the air  but were blown along the ground \\r\\nstill they brought lucilla up to the pile  and placed her upon it  and\\r\\nthen the flames divided on each side  and were blown away from her all\\r\\nround  so she sat in the midst quite unhurt  pg 29 \\nat this the people all cried out  “now we know that she really is a\\r\\nwitch  since she will not drown and the fire will not burn her ” and\\r\\nthey ran to tell the king and the queen that the dancing woman did not\\r\\nmind the fire  but sat in the midst of it unhurt  on hearing this the\\r\\nking and queen came down to the market place together  and saw lucilla\\r\\nsitting on the pile of wood  and the flames blown away from her on all\\r\\nsides  and causing a great hubbub  so they told the guards to take her\\r\\nback to prison and keep her there  till they could arrange for her to\\r\\nbe beheaded  and again lucilla bent her head  and said  “now i know \\r\\ndear windfairies  that you will never desert me  and i have nothing to\\r\\nfear  for while i keep faith with you  you will keep faith with me ” pg 30 \\nby now it was getting late in the day  and the king commanded that\\r\\nlucilla should not be executed till next day  and that the scaffold\\r\\nshould be erected in the market place  on which the block should be\\r\\nput  so that all the crowd might see  and both he and the queen would\\r\\nbe there  but in order to give her one last chance that every one might\\r\\nsee how fair they were  the king offered that if she would confess \\r\\neven when she was upon the scaffold  who had taught her to dance  she\\r\\nshould be allowed to return whence she came  and take her bag of gold\\r\\nwith her  and therefore the bag of gold was placed on the scaffold so\\r\\nthat all the people might see  and the bag was so large that lucilla\\r\\ncould scarcely lift it that evening lucilla felt no fear  and she would have slept calmly in\\r\\nher cell  but the wind was beginning to blow in all directions  and all\\r\\nround she heard it roaring  and the trees were bending and breaking\\r\\nin the gale  when the morning came  the king and queen said to each\\r\\nother  “this is the morning when they should execute the dancer  but\\r\\nit will be hard to get her on to the scaffold with a gale like this\\r\\nblowing ” however  the guards came to lucilla’s cell  and took her out\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 31 \\r\\n\\r\\nas before  and led her towards the market place  though they had much\\r\\nado to get along  for the wind blew so hard that they could scarce keep\\r\\nupright in it  all along the coast the little boats were being blown in\\r\\nto shore  and there were big ships  which had been driven in  to take\\r\\nrefuge from the storm  but lucilla felt no fear  only she looked up to\\r\\nthe wind  and in her heart she said  “now  dear windfairies  help me\\r\\nfor the last time  and keep faith with me  as i have kept faith with\\r\\nyou ”near the shore came a big ship with shining white sails  riding over\\r\\nthe crested waves  and although all the other boats seemed troubled by\\r\\nthe wind  and some were dismasted and others were wrecked  this boat\\r\\nseemed no way hurt by it  and the people who saw it called out  “what\\r\\na gallant ship it was  and how brave the captain must be  who knew\\r\\nso well how to manage wind and water ” but when they knew that the\\r\\ntime had come for lucilla to be beheaded  the people did not trouble\\r\\nfurther about the boats  and in spite of the gale they flocked to the\\r\\nmarket place  and crowded round the scaffold on which was the block  pg 32 then the guards and lucilla mounted the scaffold  and lucilla began to\\r\\nfear that at last the windfairies had forsaken her  and she wept and\\r\\nheld out her arms  and cried out  “oh  dear windfairies  indeed i have\\r\\nkept my faith with you  surely  surely you will keep yours with me ”\\r\\nin spite of the terrible gale  the king and the queen came down to the\\r\\nmarket place  though they could scarce see or hear for the wind  though\\r\\nall the time the sun was shining and the sky was blue  then the guards\\r\\nbid lucilla kneel down and place her head upon the block  and the bag\\r\\nof gold was beside her  and they said  “this is your last chance  speak\\r\\nnow and confess the truth to the king  and here is your gold  and you\\r\\nshall go ” and lucilla answered as before  “i have spoken the truth \\r\\nand there is no more that i can tell  since i have sworn never to say\\r\\nfrom whom i learnt my dancing ”then the executioner lifted the axe in the air  but before it fell \\r\\nthere came a sudden roar of wind  and the axe was swept from his hand \\r\\nand the houses in the market place tottered and fell  and high up\\r\\non the hill the palace was a mass of ruins  only lucilla knelt upon\\r\\nthe scaffold unhurt  for the king and the queen and all the people\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 33 \\r\\n\\r\\nwere blown right and left  amidst the ruins of the houses  and no one\\r\\nthought of anything save how they could save themselves then lucilla lifted her head and looked out to sea  and saw the big\\r\\nship coming in  and she heard the sailors cry  “heyday  these poor folk\\r\\nare in a sad plight  we had better go and help them ” and they all\\r\\ntrooped up into the market place  and the wind troubled them no more\\r\\nthan it had troubled their ship  but when lucilla looked at them  the\\r\\nfirst whom she saw was her husband  and she gave a great cry  and held\\r\\nout her arms  and called out  “now  dear windfairies  do i indeed know\\r\\nthat you have kept faith with me  and saved me in my direst hour of\\r\\nneed ”then she told her husband all that had happened  and showed him the\\r\\nbag of gold  and prayed him take her back to her little cottage and\\r\\nher babies by the sea  and she knew that it was the windfairies that\\r\\nhad brought her husband to her  for he told her that whatever way they\\r\\nsteered the ship it would only take one course  and the wind had blown\\r\\nit without their guidance straight\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 34 \\r\\n\\r\\nto the town where she was to be killed so lucilla and her husband took the bag of gold  and went back to the\\r\\nlittle cottage by the sea shore  and her father and her babies  and the\\r\\nking and the queen and all the rest of the people were left to build up\\r\\ntheir town as best they could  and lucilla never saw nor heard of them\\r\\nany more  but lived happily with her husband for the rest of her life  pg 35 \\nonce upon a time\\r\\nthere lived a young girl called kesta who was the dairy maid at a large\\r\\nfarm  she milked the cows and made the cheese and butter  and sometimes\\r\\ntook them into the town to sell for her master on the farm worked a man named adam  he drove in the cows for kesta to\\r\\nmilk and watched her milking them  as she was a comely looking girl and\\r\\ndid her work well  he thought she would make him a good wife  so one\\r\\nday he said  “kesta  how would you like to marry me  and then we can\\r\\nsave our money and some day buy a farm for ourselves  and i should be\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 36 \\r\\n\\r\\na farmer and you should be the farmer’s wife  and have servants to wait\\r\\non you ”“that i should like very much ” said kesta  “but i can’t say yes  at\\r\\nonce  to morrow i am going to town with my cheeses  when i come back i\\r\\nwill give you an answer ”at night kesta looked into her glass and said  “i wonder why adam\\r\\nwishes to marry me  but as he does  most likely some better man would\\r\\nlike to do so  it would be folly to marry him till i see if i can’t do\\r\\nbetter  i must look about me when i go to town to morrow  and see who i\\r\\ncan meet ”in the morning she dressed herself with great care in her best clothes \\r\\nand set out for the town with the cheeses in a basket under her arm \\r\\nwhen she had got a little way she passed a mill  and the miller all\\r\\nwhite with flour stood in the yard directing his men  he was an oldish\\r\\nman  and his wife was recently dead  and kesta thought as she drew\\r\\nnear  it would be a better thing to marry him than to marry poor adam \\r\\nso she said  “good day  would you kindly let me rest a little ” pg 37 “certainly  my girl ” said the miller  “you seem to be out of breath ”“and well i may be ” said kesta  “such a run as i have had  i’ve come\\r\\nfrom the farm yonder  and it was as much as i could do to get away  for\\r\\nthe farmer’s man was very angry because i would not marry him  and of\\r\\ncourse i am too good for him  a pretty girl like me ”“are you really a pretty girl ” said the miller  “let me see  perhaps\\r\\nyou are  well  if you are too good for the farmer’s man perhaps\\r\\nyou would suit me  how would you like to marry me  and live in the\\r\\nmill house yonder ”“i think i should like it well ” said kesta  “but i have some business\\r\\nin the town  and must go there first  so i’ll stop here and tell you as\\r\\ni come back ” so she said good bye  and went on her way feeling very\\r\\nmerry “it would be much better to marry the miller than to marry adam  but\\r\\nwho knows if i may not do better than either  so i must not be in any\\r\\nhurry ” so she walked on  and near to the town she met a man on a white\\r\\nhorse  and saw it was the bailiff of the great duke at the palace  “who\\r\\nknows but that he may want a wife ” she said to herself  “i can but\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 38 \\r\\n\\r\\ntry ” so she sat down by the road side and called out  “ah me  what a\\r\\nthing it is to be a poor girl who has to run away from all the men she\\r\\nmeets ”“why ” cried the bailiff  stopping his horse  “why have you to run  who\\r\\ntries to hurt you ”“no one tries to hurt me ” said kesta  “but i have to run from men who\\r\\nwant to marry me  because i am so pretty  at first it was a man at our\\r\\nfarm  and now it is the miller  who would not let me pass his door\\r\\nunless i promised to come back and marry him  but i am far too good for\\r\\nsuch as he ”“is this really so ” cried the bailiff  who hated the miller  “did the\\r\\nmiller really want to marry you  if you’re too good to marry him  it\\r\\nmay be you would suit me ”“indeed ” said kesta  “i think that might do well  for i should live\\r\\nin a nice house and have plenty of servants  but i have to go into the\\r\\ntown on business  and you’re sure to be somewhere about here  and when\\r\\ni come back we will arrange it ” so she set off  leaving the bailiff\\r\\nchuckling at the thought of how angry the miller would be if he married\\r\\nkesta  pg 39 on went kesta in high good humour  “now am i indeed doing well ” said\\r\\nshe  “how clever i was not to marry adam before i came to town ”\\r\\npresently she reached the town  and in the high street she passed the\\r\\nbank  and the banker himself stood in the doorway  he was fat and ugly\\r\\nand old  but his hands were covered with rings  and kesta knew his\\r\\npockets were full of gold  kesta said  “it would be a fine thing to\\r\\nmarry him  and i could hold up my head with any one  i think i’ll speak\\r\\nto him  as it would be folly to pass him without trying ” so she gave a\\r\\nloud sigh and said  “alack a day  how hard is my lot ”“why  what is wrong  my pretty lass ” said the banker “pretty you may well say ” answered kesta  “would i were not so  for\\r\\nthence come all my troubles ”“and what are they ” asked the banker “only wherever i go  i have no peace  for all the men want to marry me \\r\\nfirst it is the farmer  then the miller  and lastly the duke’s bailiff \\r\\nwho would scarcely let me pass on the road till i had promised him  and\\r\\nof course it is impossible  and i am much too pretty for any of them ” pg 40 “is this really true ” cried the banker  “if so  there must be\\r\\nsomething very superior about you  perhaps you would be good enough for\\r\\nme  how would you like to be my wife  and ride in a fine carriage  and\\r\\nwear silk gowns all day ”“nay  that would be much more fitting ” cried kesta  “and from the\\r\\nfirst i thought you would be much more suitable to be my husband than\\r\\nany of the others i have met  but i must go down the town first  so i\\r\\nwill come in here on my way back ” so she went on till she came to a\\r\\ngreat square in front of the barracks where the soldiers were drilling \\r\\nwith their helmets and swords glittering in the sun  and at their head\\r\\nrode the general of the army  his voice was hoarse with shouting at his\\r\\nmen  and he swore dreadfully  but he was covered with gold  and looked\\r\\nvery grand  “now supposing he has no wife ” thought kesta  “it would be\\r\\na really fine thing to marry him  i can but try ” so she waited till\\r\\nthe soldiers were marching into the barracks  and then  when he was\\r\\nriding away  she went so close under the horse’s feet that he shouted\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 41 \\r\\n\\r\\nto her in case she should be run over  “alas  what a life is mine ” she\\r\\ncried very loud that he might hear  “hunted here and there till i don’t\\r\\nknow where i go ”“why  who hunts you ” cried the general angrily  “what nonsense you\\r\\ntalk  my good girl ”“how dare you say i talk nonsense ” cried kesta  “when it is as much as\\r\\ni can do to get through your town for the men who want me to stop and\\r\\nmarry them ”“and why do they want you to marry them ” asked the general “because i’m so pretty  of course ” said kesta promptly  and she took\\r\\noff her hat and looked up at the general “i don’t think you are so pretty ” he said “but i am ” cried kesta angrily  “and it’s only stupid people who don’t\\r\\nsee it  go and ask the men in the town  first it was a man at the farm \\r\\nthen the miller  then the duke’s bailiff  then the banker—they all\\r\\nwanted to marry me  and i am much too good for any of them ”“if this is all true ” said the general  “of course you must be\\r\\nexceedingly pretty  and as you say you are much too good for them \\r\\nperhaps you might suit me  how would you like that ” pg 42 “that might be better ” said kesta  “and as you wish it very much i\\r\\nwill agree  and i hope you will try to make me a good husband  but i am\\r\\nobliged to go a little further on important business  and i will meet\\r\\nyou here on my way back ” and on she went laughing to herself  “indeed\\r\\ni am fortunate ” thought she  “and as they all seem willing to marry\\r\\nme why should i not try higher  and see what the duke himself would\\r\\nsay  there is nothing like being practical  and it would be downright\\r\\nsilly not to speak to the duke now i am here ” by this time she had\\r\\ncome to the duke’s palace  so she stopped a servant who was coming out\\r\\nand asked if he were at home  for she said  “i have special business\\r\\nwith him ” “he is sitting by the stream in the garden  where he sits\\r\\nfishing all day  and you can go and speak to him if you choose ” said\\r\\nthe servant  so kesta went through the courtyard into the garden  and\\r\\nstraight on to where the duke sat beside the stream with a long rod in\\r\\nhis hand fishing  he was dressed all in green  and seemed to be half\\r\\nasleep  and kesta came quite near him before he saw her  then she\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 43 \\r\\n\\r\\nsaid  “ah  pity me  your grace  and listen to my sad story ”“good gracious  who are you —don’t you know i am the duke ” said he “and that is why i have come to you to ask you to protect me from all\\r\\nthe men who pursue me ” said kesta “why do they pursue you ” asked the duke “because i am so pretty ” replied kesta  “they all want to marry me \\r\\nfirst the man at the farm  then the miller i met on the road  then your\\r\\nbailiff  then the banker  then the general of your army  and he would\\r\\nonly let me go when i promised to go back to him ”“the general ” said the duke  “is this true  does he really want to\\r\\nmarry you ”“of course he does ” said kesta  “if you doubt what i say you had\\r\\nbetter send to the town and ask ”“indeed ” said the duke  “i should not have thought you so very pretty \\r\\nbut if what you say is true you must be  i’m not sure if it would not\\r\\nsuit me to marry you myself  but mind  i shall be exceedingly angry if\\r\\ni find you have not told me the truth  and they did not want to marry\\r\\nyou  of course you would be delighted to marry me and be the duchess ” pg 44 “aye  that i should ” cried kesta  and she grinned with delight then the duke took from his side a horn and blew it loudly  there came\\r\\nfrom the palace four pages  dressed in blue and gold  who stood in a\\r\\nrow to receive his orders  “see ” cried the duke  “i am going to marry\\r\\nthis lady  who everybody thinks is very beautiful  so see that you\\r\\ntreat her with respect  and go to the palace and bid them to prepare a\\r\\nfeast and fitting clothes for the bride  and tell the chaplain to be\\r\\nready  for i mean to marry her at once ”“and now ” he said to kesta  when all his pages had returned to the\\r\\npalace  “come and sit by me and watch me fish till all is ready ”so kesta sat by his side and watched him fishing with his long rod  but\\r\\nafter a time she grew tired of being silent  and said  “what have you\\r\\ncaught ”“nothing yet ” said the duke “then why do you go on ” asked she “because i’m sure to catch something soon  and it’s amusing  wouldn’t\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 45 \\r\\n\\r\\nyou like to hold the rod a little ”“yes  very much ” answered kesta  who was afraid of offending him  so\\r\\nshe put out her hand to take the rod  and as she did so the basket fell\\r\\nfrom her arm and the cheeses rolled out “what are those round balls ” asked the duke  “and what an odd smell\\r\\nthey have ”“they are my cheeses ” cried kesta  “i made them yesterday  and was\\r\\ntaking them to sell  when——”“good gracious  you made them ” cried the duke with a scream  “then\\r\\nyou must be a common dairy maid  and your hands are quite rough \\r\\nhow terrible  and i was just going to marry you  how dare you think\\r\\nyourself good enough to marry me ” and he sprang to his feet in a\\r\\ntowering passion  and seizing his horn blew it so loudly that the four\\r\\npages ran up in great alarm  “hunt her away ” cried the duke  “she is\\r\\nan impostor—a common farm wench and makes cheeses  she thought herself\\r\\ngood enough to be the duchess ”away flew kesta  with the pages after her hooting and shouting  “down\\r\\nwith the impertinent hussy who wanted to marry the duke  a common\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 46 \\r\\n\\r\\ndairy maid who makes cheeses ”on rushed kesta till she came to the general’s house  and at his window\\r\\nhe sat in his fine uniform  he sat waiting for her  but when he saw the\\r\\npages behind her he called  “hey dey  what is all this fuss about ”“it is nothing ” said kesta  “see  i have come back to marry you as i\\r\\npromised ”but here the pages shouted  “away with the impertinent dairy maid  who\\r\\nthought herself good enough to marry the duke ”“and wouldn’t the duke marry her ” asked the general “of course not  she is nothing but a farm wench ” cried the pages  “and\\r\\nshe is to be chased from the town for her impertinence ”“and so she shall ” cried the general  “she thought she was fit for me\\r\\ntoo—it is disgraceful ” and he cried to some soldiers who stood by his\\r\\ndoor  “here  my men  help to chase this good for nothing hussy out of\\r\\nthe town ”but before he had finished kesta was running down the street with all\\r\\nher might to the banker’s  at last she came to the banker’s big square\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 47 \\r\\n\\r\\nhouse standing beside the bank  and on the steps was the banker himself\\r\\nin his shiny black clothes with gold rings on his hands “here i am ” cried kesta  “and let me in quickly  for i am out of\\r\\nbreath with running ”“why have you hurried so ” cried the banker  and as he spoke the pages\\r\\nand the soldiers came round the corner  “and what is all this shouting\\r\\nfor ”“nay  how should i know ” cried kesta  running into the house but up came her pursuers  crying  “away with her  down with her ”“who is it you are calling after ” asked the banker “that wench in the yellow dress who has gone into your house ”“why  what has she done ” he asked “why  she thought herself good enough to marry the duke and the\\r\\ngeneral  and she is to be hooted out of the town for her impudence ”“but didn’t the general want to marry her ” asked the banker “our general ” cried the soldiers angrily  “why  she’s only a\\r\\ndairy maid  and not fit for him ” pg 48 “then i’m sure she can’t be good enough for me  for i’m quite as good\\r\\nas he ” said the banker  and he ran into the house in a great rage \\r\\ncrying  “begone  you impertinent jade  how dare you think yourself good\\r\\nenough for me to marry ” it chanced at this moment that the clerks were\\r\\ncoming out of the bank next door  and when he saw them he cried  “here \\r\\nmy good fellows  help to chase this minx from the town  she wishes to\\r\\nbe my wife  when she is nothing but a common dairy maid ” on this the\\r\\nclerks burst out laughing  and one and all ran after kesta  who ran\\r\\nwith all her might and main “it’s too hard ” sobbed she  “what have i done to be treated like\\r\\nthis ” but run as fast as she might she could not reach the bailiff’s\\r\\nhouse before them  and the pages  soldiers  and clerks were all close\\r\\nto her  shouting and laughing “why  what’s the matter ” cried the bailiff  “and why are you shouting\\r\\nat this poor maid ”“why ” said they  “she wanted to marry first the duke  and the general \\r\\nand the banker  and of course they would not have her  because she is\\r\\nonly a common dairy wench ”“what impertinence ” cried the bailiff  “and  now i come to think of\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 49 \\r\\n\\r\\nit  she asked to marry me too  indeed she merits punishment for such\\r\\nbehaviour ” and seeing some of his farm people close at hand  he bid\\r\\nthem run after kesta and drive her out of the town  but this time she\\r\\nhad started first  and had got on to the mill before they could reach\\r\\nher  and she ran into the garden where the miller was  “well  i’m glad\\r\\nto see you back ” said he  “but how hard you have run ”“i was in such a hurry to get back  now let’s go into the house ” she\\r\\nsaid “come along ” said the miller  “but what are all those people shouting\\r\\nfor ”“’tis only the farmers bringing home pigs from the market ” said kesta \\r\\nbut she felt frightened  for she heard the people calling after her “pigs don’t make a noise like that ” said the miller  “i will go and\\r\\nsee what it is about ” and when he heard that they were all shouting\\r\\nat kesta  he flew into a violent rage and cried  “if she wasn’t good\\r\\nenough for the bailiff i’m sure she’s not fit for me ” and he called\\r\\nto some of his men who were working at the mill  “see there  my men \\r\\ndo you see that girl  throw some flour at her  for she is an impudent\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 50 \\r\\n\\r\\nhussy  and asked me to marry her ”away flew kesta again  and after her came all the crowd in a long line \\r\\n“how unfortunate i am ” she sobbed  “but anyhow i can go back to adam \\r\\nhe’s sure to be glad to have me ” and on she sped  and at last she came\\r\\nto the farm and ran in  calling to adam “is that you  kesta ” cried adam  coming to meet her  and kissing her \\r\\n“i’m glad to see you  but why are you so hot ”“it is the sun  it was so strong ” said kesta “then sit down and grow cool ” said adam  “but i wonder what all that\\r\\nshouting outside can be ”“it is only people making holiday ” cried kesta  but for all she could\\r\\nsay adam went out to ask the people what they wanted at the farm “we want nothing at the farm ” they cried  “but we followed that\\r\\nimpudent wench dressed in yellow ”“why  what has she done ” asked adam “done ” they cried  “why  she came up to the town and asked to marry\\r\\nthe miller  and the banker  and the bailiff  and the general  and even\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 51 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe duke himself  so she deserves to be punished for her presumption ”then adam looked very grave  and went back to the farm and said \\r\\n“indeed  kesta  i cannot marry you now  since you’ve been to the town\\r\\nand tried to get a finer husband than me ” and he went back to his\\r\\nwork  and left kesta sitting all alone  and there she sat and cried\\r\\nby herself  and did not get any husband after all  because she was so\\r\\nfalse and vain  pg 52 once there was\\r\\na tree standing in the middle of a vast wilderness  and beneath the\\r\\nshade of its branches was a little pool  over which they bent  the pool\\r\\nlooked up at the tree and the tree looked down at the pool  and the\\r\\ntwo loved each other better than anything else on earth  and neither\\r\\nof them thought of anything else but each other  or cared who came and\\r\\nwent in the world around them “but for you and the shade you give me i should have been dried up by\\r\\nthe sun long ago ” said the pool  pg 53 “and if it were not for you and your shining face  i should never have\\r\\nseen myself  or have known what my boughs and blossoms were like ”\\r\\nanswered the tree every year when the leaves and flowers had died away from the branches\\r\\nof the tree  and the cold winter came  the little pool froze over and\\r\\nremained hard and silent till the spring  but directly the sun’s rays\\r\\nthawed it  it again sparkled and danced as the wind blew upon it \\r\\nand it began to watch its beloved friend  to see the buds and leaves\\r\\nreappear  and together they counted the leaves and blossoms as they\\r\\ncame forth one day there rode over the moorland a couple of travellers in search\\r\\nof rare plants and flowers  at first they did not look at the tree  but\\r\\nas they were hot and tired they got off their horses  and sat under the\\r\\nshade of the boughs  and talked of what they had been doing  “we have\\r\\nnot found much ” said one gloomily  “it seemed scarcely worth while to\\r\\ncome so far for so little ”“one may hunt for many years before one finds anything very rare ”\\r\\nanswered the elder traveller  “well  we have not done  and who knows\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 54 \\r\\n\\r\\nbut what we may yet have some luck ” as he spoke he picked up one of\\r\\nthe fallen leaves of the tree which lay beside him  and at once he\\r\\nsprang to his feet  and pulled down one of the branches to examine it \\r\\nthen he called to his comrade to get up  and he also closely examined\\r\\nthe leaves and blossoms  and they talked together eagerly  and at\\r\\nlength declared that this was the best thing they had found in all\\r\\ntheir travels  but neither the pool nor the tree heeded them  for the\\r\\npool lay looking lovingly up to the tree  and the tree gazed down at\\r\\nthe clear water of the pool  and they wanted nothing more  and by and\\r\\nby the travellers mounted their horses and rode away the summer passed and the cold winds of autumn blew “soon your leaves will drop and you will fall asleep for the winter \\r\\nand we must bid each other good bye ” said the pool “and you too when the frost comes will be numbed to ice ” answered the\\r\\ntree  “but never mind  the spring will follow  and the sun will wake us\\r\\nboth ” pg 55 but long before the winter had set in  ere yet the last leaf had\\r\\nfallen  there came across the prairie a number of men riding on horses\\r\\nand mules  bringing with them a long waggon  they rode straight to the\\r\\ntree  and foremost among them were the two travellers who had been\\r\\nthere before “why do they come  what do they want ” cried the pool uneasily  but\\r\\nthe tree feared nothing  the men had spades and pickaxes  and began to\\r\\ndig a deep ditch all round the tree’s roots  and then they dug beneath\\r\\nthem  and at last both the pool and the tree saw that they were going\\r\\nto dig it up “what are you doing  why are you trying to wrench up my roots and to\\r\\nmove me ” cried the tree  “don’t you know that i shall die if you drag\\r\\nme from my pool which has fed and loved me all my life ” and the pool\\r\\nsaid  “oh  what can they want  why do they take you  the sun will come\\r\\nand dry me up without your shade  and i never  never shall see you\\r\\nagain ” but the men heard nothing  and continued to dig at the root of\\r\\nthe tree till they had loosened all the earth round it  and then they\\r\\nlifted it and wrapped big cloths round it and put it on their waggon\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 56 \\r\\n\\r\\nand drove away with it then for the first time the pool looked straight up at the sky without\\r\\nseeing the delicate tracery made by the leaves and twigs against the\\r\\nblue  and it called out to all things near it  “my tree  my tree  where\\r\\nhave they taken my tree  when the hot sun comes it will dry me up  if\\r\\nit shines down on me without the shade of my tree ” and so loudly it\\r\\nmourned and lamented that the birds flying past heard it  and at last\\r\\na swallow paused on the wing  and hovering near its surface  asked why\\r\\nit grieved so bitterly  “they have taken my tree ” cried the pool  “and\\r\\ni don’t know where it is  i cannot move or look to right or left  so i\\r\\nshall never see it again ”“ask the moon ” said the swallow  “the moon sees everywhere  and she\\r\\nwill tell you  i am flying away to warmer countries  for the winter\\r\\nwill soon be here  good bye  poor pool ”at night  when the moon rose  and the pool looked up and saw its\\r\\nbeautiful white face  it remembered the swallow’s words  and called out\\r\\nto ask its aid “find me my tree ” it prayed  “you shone through its branches and know\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 57 \\r\\n\\r\\nit well  and you can see all over the world  look for my tree  and tell\\r\\nme where they have taken it  perhaps they have torn it in pieces or\\r\\nburnt it up ”“nay ” cried the moon  “they have done neither  for i saw it a few\\r\\nhours ago when i shone near it  they have taken it many miles away and\\r\\nit is planted in a big garden  but it has not taken root in the earth \\r\\nand its foliage is fading  the men who took it prize it heartily  and\\r\\nstrangers come from far and near to look at it  because they say it is\\r\\nso rare  and there are only one or two like it in the world ”on hearing this the pool felt itself swell with pride that the tree\\r\\nshould be so much admired  but then it cried in anguish  “and i shall\\r\\nnever see it again  for i can never move from here ”“that is nonsense ” cried a little cloud that was sailing near  “i was\\r\\nonce in the earth like you  to morrow  if the sun shines brightly  he\\r\\nwill draw you up into the sky  and you can sail along till you find\\r\\nyour tree ”“is that true ” cried the pool  and all that night it rested in peace\\r\\nwaiting for the sun to rise  next day there were no clouds  and when\\r\\nthe pool saw the sun shining it cried  “draw me up into the sky  dear\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 58 \\r\\n\\r\\nsun  that i may be a little cloud and sail all the world over  till i\\r\\ncan find my beloved tree ”when the sun heard it  he threw down hundreds of tiny golden threads\\r\\nwhich dropped over the pool  and slowly and gradually it began to\\r\\nchange and grow thinner and lighter  and to rise through the air  till\\r\\nat last it had quite left the earth  and where it had lain before \\r\\nthere was nothing but a dry hole  but the pool itself was transformed\\r\\ninto a tiny cloud  and was sailing above in the blue sky in the\\r\\nsunshine  there were many other little clouds in the sky  but our\\r\\nlittle cloud kept apart from them all  it could see far and near over a\\r\\ngreat space of country  but nowhere could it espy the tree  and again\\r\\nit turned to the sun for help  “can you see ” it cried  “you who see\\r\\neverywhere  where is my tree ”“you can’t see it yet ” answered the sun  “for it is away on the other\\r\\nside of the world  but presently the wind will begin to blow and it\\r\\nwill blow you till you find it ”then the wind arose  and the cloud sailed along swiftly  looking\\r\\neverywhere as it went for the tree  it could have had a merry time if\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 59 \\r\\n\\r\\nit had not longed so for its friend  everywhere was the golden sunlight\\r\\nshining through the bright blue sky  and the other clouds tumbled and\\r\\ndanced in the wind and laughed for joy “why do you not come and dance with us ” they cried  “why do you sail\\r\\non so rapidly ”“i cannot stay  i am seeking a lost friend ” answered the cloud  and\\r\\nit scudded past them  leaving them to roll over and over  and tumble\\r\\nabout  and change their shapes  and divide and separate  and play a\\r\\nthousand pranks for many hundred miles the wind blew the little cloud  then it said \\r\\n“now i am tired and shall take you no further  but soon the west wind\\r\\nwill come and it will take you on  good bye ” and at once the wind\\r\\nstopped blowing and dropped to rest on the earth  and the cloud stood\\r\\nstill in the sky and looked all around “i shall never find it ” it sighed  “it will be dead before i come ”presently the sun went down and the moon rose  then the west wind began\\r\\nto blow gently and moved the cloud slowly along  pg 60 “which way should i go  where is it ” entreated the cloud “i know  i will take you straight to it ” said the west wind  “the\\r\\nnorth wind has told me  i blew by the tree to day  it was drooping  but\\r\\nwhen i told it that you had risen to the sky and were seeking it  it\\r\\nrevived and tried to lift its branches  they have planted it in a great\\r\\ngarden  and there are railings round it and no one may touch it  and\\r\\nthere is one gardener who has nothing to do but to attend to it  and\\r\\npeople come from far and near to look at it because it is so rare  and\\r\\nthey have only found one or two others like it  but it longs to be back\\r\\nin the desert  stooping over you and seeing its face in your water ”“make haste  then ” cried the cloud  “lest before i reach it i fall to\\r\\npieces with joy at the thought of seeing it ”“how foolish you are ” said the wind  “why should you give yourself up\\r\\nfor a tree  you might dance about in the sky for long yet  and then you\\r\\nmight drop into the sea and mix with the waves and rise again with them\\r\\nto the sky  but if you fall about the tree you will go straight into\\r\\nthe dark earth  and perhaps you will always\\r\\nremain there  for at the roots of the tree they have made a deep hole\\r\\nand the sun cannot draw you up through the earth under the branches ” pg 61 62  pg 63 “then that will be what i long for ” cried the cloud  “for then i can\\r\\nlie in the dark where no one may see me  but i shall be close to my\\r\\ntree  and i can touch its roots and feed them  and when the raindrops\\r\\nfall from its branches they will run down to me and tell me how they\\r\\nlook ”“you are foolish ” said the wind again  “but you shall have what you\\r\\nwant ”the wind blew the cloud low down near the earth till it found itself\\r\\nover a big garden  in which there were all sorts of trees and shrubs \\r\\nand such soft green grass as the cloud had never seen before  and there\\r\\nin the middle of the grass  in a bed of earth to itself  with a railing\\r\\nround it so that no one could injure it  was the tree which the cloud\\r\\nhad come so far to seek  its leaves were falling off  its branches were\\r\\ndrooping  and its buds dropped before they opened  and the poor tree\\r\\nlooked as if it were dying “there is my tree  my tree ” called the cloud  “blow me down  dear\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 64 \\r\\n\\r\\nwind  so that i may fall upon it ”the wind blew the cloud lower and lower  till it almost touched the top\\r\\nbranches of the tree  then it broke and fell in a shower  and crept\\r\\ndown through the earth to its roots  and when it felt its drops the\\r\\ntree lifted up its leaves and rejoiced  for it knew that the pool it\\r\\nhad loved so had followed it “have you come at last ” it cried  “then we need never be parted again ”in the morning when the gardeners came they found the tree looking\\r\\nquite fresh and well  and its leaves quite green and crisp  “the cool\\r\\nwind last night revived it ” they said  “and it looks as if it had\\r\\nrained too in the night  for round here the earth is quite damp ” but\\r\\nthey did not know that under the earth at the tree’s roots lay the\\r\\npool  and that that was what had saved the tree and there it lies to this day  hidden away in the darkness where no\\r\\none can see it  but the tree feels it with its roots  and blooms in\\r\\nsplendour  and people come from far and near to admire it  pg 65 \\nonce there lived a\\r\\nyoung girl called nanina  who kept sheep for an old farmer  one day he\\r\\nsaid to her  “nanina  i’m going away to buy pigs at a market far off \\r\\nand i shall be away one whole month  so be sure and take good care of\\r\\nthe flock  and remember  there are six sheep and eight lambs  and i\\r\\nmust find them safe when i return  and mind \\r\\n\\r\\n pg 66 \\r\\n\\r\\nnanina  that whatever you do  you don’t go near the old palace on the\\r\\nother side of the hill  for it is filled with wicked fairies who might\\r\\ndo you an ill turn ” nanina promised  and her master started the first day all went well  and she drove the flock in safely at\\r\\nnight  but the next day she found it dull sitting on the hillside\\r\\nwatching the lambs at play  and wondered why her master had told her\\r\\nalways to keep on that side  and away from the old palace on the other “if it is filled with fairies ” quoth she  “it won’t hurt me just to\\r\\nlook at it  i should like to see a fairy ” so she drove her flock to\\r\\nthe other side of the hill  and sat looking at the old palace that was\\r\\nhalf in ruins  but was said to be lit up quite brightly every night\\r\\nafter it was dark “i wonder if it really is lit up ” said nanina  “i should like to see ”\\r\\nso she waited on that side of the hill till the sun went down  and\\r\\nthen she saw a bright light appearing in one of the palace windows \\r\\nas she stood and watched  the front door opened  and out there came a\\r\\nshepherd boy followed by a flock of black goats  nanina stared at him \\r\\nfor she had never seen any one so beautiful before  he was dressed in\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 67 \\r\\n\\r\\nglittering green  and wore a soft brown hat trimmed with leaves under\\r\\nwhich his curls hung down  in one hand he held a crook and in the\\r\\nother a pipe  and as he drew near  he began to play the pipe and dance\\r\\nmerrily  while the goats behind him skipped and danced too  nanina had\\r\\nnever seen such goats  they were jet black  with locks curling and\\r\\nthick and soft as silk  as she listened open mouthed to the music of\\r\\nthe pipe  she heard it speak words in its playing —the shepherd boy danced lightly to where she\\r\\nstood  and louder and louder sounded the pipe \\r\\nand still it said—nanina gaped to see the goats dance and spring\\r\\nin time to the music  and so cheering it was  that\\r\\nshe felt her own feet beginning to move with it \\r\\nthe shepherd made her a low bow and offered\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 68 \\r\\n\\r\\nher his hand  and she placed hers in it  and off they\\r\\nstarted together  nanina’s feet felt as light as\\r\\nif they had been made of cork  and she laughed\\r\\nwith glee as she bounded on  and as she danced\\r\\nwith the shepherd  so her flock began to move\\r\\ntoo  and thus they went  followed by the black\\r\\ngoats and sheep all skipping merrily  “if my\\r\\nflock follow me there can be no harm ” thought\\r\\nnanina  and on they kept in time to the wonderful\\r\\ntune—whither they went she knew not  she thought of nothing but the joy of\\r\\ndancing to the wonderful music  but suddenly  just ere sunrise  the\\r\\nshepherd stopped  and dropped her hand and gave one long slow note on\\r\\nthe pipe  at which the goats gathered round him  and before she knew\\r\\nwhere they were going  they had disappeared into the palace  then she\\r\\nwas in a terrible fright  for she saw the sun beginning to rise  and\\r\\nfound the whole night had passed  when she thought she had only been\\r\\nten minutes  she counted her sheep  and  alas  there was one lamb\\r\\nmissing  pg 69  pg 70 she sought everywhere for it  but no trace of it was to be seen  then\\r\\nshe drove all the others back to the farm and watched them  falling\\r\\nhalf asleep  for she was weary with the dancing  but when evening\\r\\ncame  and she had slept some time  she said to herself  “surely the\\r\\nbest plan would be to go back to the old palace  and see if i can see\\r\\nthe shepherd and the black goats again ” so just about sunset she\\r\\nreturned to the palace  and again the door opened  and the beautiful\\r\\nshepherd boy came out with the black goats following  but when he began\\r\\nto play on his pipe  and the goats to dance  nanina forgot all about\\r\\nthe lost lamb and danced with him as before  again they danced till\\r\\nmorning  and then he left her suddenly  and she found that another lamb\\r\\nhad disappeared  then she wept and lamented  and declared that the next\\r\\nnight she would only watch the shepherd and nothing would make her\\r\\ndance  and again the next night the same thing happened  when once she\\r\\nheard the pipe  nanina could not keep still  and another lamb was lost \\r\\nthis went on to the end of a fortnight  when there was only one of the\\r\\nflock left  then she was terribly frightened  for her master would soon\\r\\nreturn  and she did not know what she should say to him  but still she\\r\\nwent back and sat by the old palace  and when the shepherd came out \\r\\nand she heard the music  she could not refrain from dancing  and in\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 71 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe morning the last lamb had gone all the day nanina wandered about and cried  but no sheep were to be\\r\\nfound  at last  when she was quite weary  she sat down beneath a beech\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 72 \\r\\n\\r\\ntree near the palace  and leaned her head against its trunk sobbing \\r\\nthen she saw that someone had torn down the lowest branches of the\\r\\ntree and they were hanging down broken  she raised them and tied them\\r\\nup  so that they would grow together  and as she did so she heard a\\r\\nshadowy voice whisper  “thank you  nanina  nanina  don’t dance ” she\\r\\nlooked about but there was nobody there  and again she heard a whisper \\r\\n“nanina  don’t dance ” the voice came from the beech tree  and among\\r\\nthe leaves she saw a small twisted face looking at her  “thank you \\r\\nnanina  for saving my bough ” said the tree  “and if you mind me  you\\r\\nshall get all your sheep back again ”“my sheep ” cried nanina  “only tell me  and i will do anything ”“then you must not dance  every time you refuse to dance with the\\r\\nfairy  one of your flock will be returned ”“but how can i refuse to dance ” cried nanina  “for as i hear the\\r\\npipe beginning  my feet begin to move of themselves  it is no use my\\r\\ntrying ” and she cried aloud “bury your feet in the earth like my roots ” whispered back the voice \\r\\n\\r\\n pg 73 \\r\\n\\r\\n“dig a hole deep down  and i will hold your feet so that you shall not\\r\\nmove them  only you must bear the pain  and not mind if you walk lame\\r\\nafterwards  for i shall hold them very tight  and it will hurt you ”“hurt me as you please ” cried nanina  “and i shan’t mind  if only i\\r\\ncan get back my sheep i will bear any pain ” so she knelt beneath the\\r\\ntree  and dug a deep hole in the ground among its roots  and then she\\r\\nplaced her feet among the loose earth  and she felt something moving\\r\\nnear them which tightened around and drew them far down into the\\r\\nground  and held them as if they were bound with cords  she saw the\\r\\nlights in the windows of the palace  and the door opened  “hold me \\r\\nhold me fast ” she cried  “for when i hear the music i shall begin to\\r\\ndance ” the tree said nothing  but she felt its roots tightening so\\r\\nthat she could not move  the door of the palace opened as before  and\\r\\nthe beautiful shepherd  followed by his goats and her sheep  came out \\r\\nand she heard once more the sound of the wonderful pipe  and he danced\\r\\nstraight up to the tree beneath which she stood  and held out his hand\\r\\nto her  nanina felt as if her feet were beginning to move under the\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 74 \\r\\n\\r\\nearth  but the roots of the tree held them so firmly that she could not\\r\\nstir one inch  still the shepherd danced before her  and as she saw\\r\\nhim springing in front  with the flocks behind him following him  she\\r\\ngrew quite wild to dance  and tried her hardest to break her feet free\\r\\nfrom the roots which held them  but in vain  though she almost screamed\\r\\nwith the pain they cost her  for hours the shepherd danced in front\\r\\nof her  till  as before  the pipe sounded forth one long note  and he\\r\\ndisappeared  but this time not all the flock went with him  for beside\\r\\nher was left one of her own little lambs  and when she saw it she\\r\\ncried for joy  she felt the roots releasing their hold of her feet \\r\\n\\r\\n pg 75 \\r\\n\\r\\nand she drew them out of the earth  and they were all blue and bruised\\r\\nwhere they had been held  she drove home the lamb and fastened it into\\r\\nthe sheep pen  but her feet were so stiff and swelled that she limped\\r\\nas she walked  next night she went back to the beech tree  and again\\r\\nslipped her feet into its roots  and felt them twist around them  but\\r\\nthis time the poor feet were so sore that she cried when they touched\\r\\nthem  again the fairy appeared  and again she heard the pipe  and her\\r\\nlonging to dance was worse than ever  but the roots clutched her and\\r\\nwould not let her stir  when the pipe ceased and the fairy disappeared \\r\\nanother of her lambs was left with her  and she drove it home as she\\r\\nhad done the first  but she had to go very slowly on account of her\\r\\ncrushed feet the same thing happened the next night and the next  till all the flock\\r\\nhad returned save one  and nanina’s feet were so bad that she could\\r\\nscarcely hobble  for they were crushed and bleeding  and she wondered\\r\\nwhether she would walk lame all the days of her life on the last evening she limped down to the tree almost crying with\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 76 \\r\\n\\r\\npain  when she sat down by its trunk she heard the soft sighing voice\\r\\nsaying  “never mind  nanina  to night is the last  and though it will\\r\\nhurt you the most  it will soon be past ” so she slipped her feet into\\r\\nthe earth once more  though she shrank as they touched it  and directly\\r\\nthe sun had set  the lights appeared in the palace windows  and out\\r\\ncame the shepherd with all his black goats and her one white sheep\\r\\nfollowing him  he looked more beautiful than ever  for he had a crown\\r\\nset with jewels  and was dressed in scarlet and gold  but when the pipe\\r\\nbegan to play it was not merry dance music it made  but long sad notes \\r\\nlike a funeral march  yet nanina’s feet would have moved in spite of\\r\\nherself  and she would have marched in time to them  had not the roots\\r\\ntightened like cords and held her down  tears of pain ran down her\\r\\ncheeks  and she sobbed  and instead of the joyous words what the music\\r\\nsaid was— pg 77 78  pg 79 presently the music grew quicker  and her longing to move with it\\r\\ngrew stronger  she swayed herself about  and cried and screamed as\\r\\nthe fairy and flock danced  now solemnly and slowly  now joyously and\\r\\nwildly  just when she felt that she could bear it no longer there came\\r\\none long low note on the pipe  and with a mighty crash like thunder the\\r\\nshepherd and the goats disappeared  and not only had they gone  but the\\r\\nwalls of the old palace had fallen  and nothing was left of it but a\\r\\nheap of stones  beside her on the grass was the last of her lost sheep \\r\\n“good bye  nanina ” said the voice from the beech tree  “now you have\\r\\nall your flock again ” and she felt the roots loosen round her feet \\r\\nbut when she looked at them she found that her legs were wounded and\\r\\nbleeding  where she had dashed them about in trying to dance  she knelt\\r\\ndown and smoothed over the earth where it was torn up among the trees \\r\\nand she put her arms round the trunk and kissed and thanked it for\\r\\nhaving helped her  but the voice did not speak again  then she drove\\r\\nhome the last sheep  but she had to go on her hands and knees  for her\\r\\nfeet were too bad to walk next day when the farmer came home  he was well pleased that she had\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 80 \\r\\n\\r\\nkept his flock safe  but he would fain know how she had got such sore\\r\\nfeet that for long she must walk lame  “of a truth  master ” she quoth \\r\\n“it was in saving the lambs when they got into dangerous places ”underneath the beech tree  where nanina’s feet had bled among the\\r\\nearth  there sprang up pretty little scarlet flowers  and whenever\\r\\nshe passed and saw them she remembered how she had been punished for\\r\\ndisobeying her master  and made up her mind never to do so again  pg 81 \\nin a little village there lived a young potter  who made his living by\\r\\nmaking all sorts of earthenware  he took the clay  and made it into\\r\\nshapes on the wheel  and then baked his cups and jars in a kiln  he\\r\\nmade big jugs and little jugs  and basins and cups and saucers  and\\r\\nindeed every sort of pot or jar that could be wanted  he was very\\r\\nfond of his work  and was always thinking of how to make new shapes \\r\\nor colour his jars with pretty colours  it was a very tiny village\\r\\nhe lived in  and he worked at throwing his pots on his wheel by the\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 82 \\r\\n\\r\\nroad side  but people came from many other villages and towns to buy\\r\\nhis ware  once a year there was a big fair  held in the town near  and\\r\\njust before it  the potter was always very busy making new pots and\\r\\njugs to sell there  a few nights before the fair was to be held  he was\\r\\nhard at work  trying to finish a number of little bowls  so he sat at\\r\\nhis wheel late in the evening after the sun was set  all day long the\\r\\nroad had been gay with folk coming to the fair  some were in carts \\r\\nand some were on foot  and there were a number of gipsies in caravans \\r\\nbringing all sorts of goods to sell  most of them went through the\\r\\nvillage and on to a big common a little further on  where they got out\\r\\nof their carts and put up tents  to sleep in while the fair went on \\r\\nthe potter was so busy with his little basins on his turning wheel\\r\\nthat he did not hear the sound of footsteps  and when he looked up  he\\r\\nwas surprised to see a young gipsy girl standing near  watching him \\r\\nshe was quite young  and had big black eyes  and rosy round cheeks \\r\\nand her black hair was twisted up in little red beads and chains  she\\r\\nwas dressed in some very gay stuff  and round her neck was a gold\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 83 \\r\\n\\r\\nnecklace  and on her fingers and arms were rings and bracelets “that should be a fine cup ” said the girl  “since you keep your eyes\\r\\non it and can look at nothing else ”“i keep my eyes for my work  that i may do it well ” said the potter \\r\\n“for i live by my work  and neither by stealing nor begging ”“but i fancy many others can do your work as well  or better than you ”\\r\\nanswered the gipsy  “what can your cups do when they are finished  i\\r\\ndon’t hear you say anything to them  so i should think they would be\\r\\nstupid cups—only fit to drink out of ”“and what else should they be for ” asked the potter angrily  “what do\\r\\nyou mean by saying that you don’t hear me saying anything to my cups \\r\\ni don’t think you know what you are talking about  it is nonsense  and\\r\\nyou are talking nonsense ”“my grandfather used to make pots on a wheel ” said the gipsy  and she\\r\\nlaughed low  and showed her white teeth in the moonlight  “ah  but he\\r\\nknew how to do them  and he had charms to say to them when he threw\\r\\nthem  and one of his cups would make you wise if you drank out of it \\r\\n\\r\\n pg 84 \\r\\n\\r\\nand another would give you your true love’s heart if she drank from it \\r\\nand another would make you forget everything—yes  even your true love \\r\\nand all your mirth and all your sorrow  and i think that was the best\\r\\ncup of all ” and again the gipsy laughed in the moonlight  and sang a\\r\\nlittle song to herself as she sat herself down before the potter “now this is real child’s talk ” said the potter very impatiently \\r\\n“’tis easy to say your grandfather knew how to do all this  but why\\r\\nshould i believe you  and because your grandfather may have been able\\r\\nto throw a bowl upon the wheel  that doesn’t make you know anything\\r\\nabout the craft  or how it is done ”“nay  but he taught me too ” said the gipsy  “give me a piece of your\\r\\nclay  and let me come to your wheel and you shall see ”at first the potter thought she was talking nonsense  but to his great\\r\\nsurprise she took hold of the clay in her little brown hands  and\\r\\nmoulded and modelled it with the greatest skill  then she placed it on\\r\\nthe wheel and threw a little jug  and he wondered to see how deft she\\r\\nwas  pg 85 “now i will make you a little bowl ” she said  and then she made jugs\\r\\nand pots and jars  far more quickly and skilfully than the potter could\\r\\nhave done  “and now i will colour them too ” she cried  “see  i shall\\r\\ncatch the colour from the moon  and to morrow you can put them into\\r\\nyour kiln and bake them  and you may be sure that you have never had\\r\\nsuch pots there before ” then she put her little brown hands out into\\r\\nthe moonlight  and they were covered with rings which glittered and\\r\\nshone  but as she held up her palms to the moon’s rays  it seemed to\\r\\nthe potter as if they too were full of some strange glittering liquid \\r\\n“and now ” she said  “see  i will put it on to your pots  and i should\\r\\nthink i had taught you that i know more about your trade than you do\\r\\nyourself ” and she took the pots in her hands and rubbed her palms over\\r\\nthem  and she traced patterns on them with her fingers the potter looked at her and felt almost angry  but she only laughed in\\r\\nhis face “and now one last thing ” she cried  “and that is  that i will make\\r\\nyou a cup that has a spell in it  and it shall be a present for you\\r\\nto remember me by  it will be very plain  and there will be no gay\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 86 \\r\\n\\r\\ncolours in it  but when you give it to your true love to drink from \\r\\nif once you have drunk from it yourself  you will have all her heart \\r\\nbut beware that she doesn’t take a second draught  for though the first\\r\\ndraught that she drinks will be drunk to love  the second draught will\\r\\nbe drunk to hate  and though she have loved you more than all else on\\r\\nearth  all her love will turn to hate when she drinks again  and as you\\r\\nare so ignorant how to make bowls and cups  you will not know how to\\r\\nfashion one so as to win back her love again ”the potter stared in silence  while the gipsy took another bit of\\r\\nclay and placed it upon the wheel  and then she bent her head  which\\r\\nglittered with beads and coins  low over it  and placing her rosy lips\\r\\nclose to the mouth of the cup  sang some words into it  while she\\r\\nmoulded it with her hands  and turned the wheel with her foot  it was\\r\\nin some strange language that the potter had never heard before “good bye ” she said presently  “now  there  that is for you  and be\\r\\nsure you do not sell the little brown cup  but keep it and give it to\\r\\nyour true love to drink out of  but only one draught  for if there\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 87 \\r\\n\\r\\nare two maybe you will need the gipsy’s help again ” then she laughed \\r\\nand nodding her head over her shoulder  tripped lightly away in the\\r\\nmoonlight while the potter stared after her at first he thought he had been asleep  but there around him stood the\\r\\nlittle rows of jugs and pots which the gipsy had made  and truly they\\r\\nwere beautifully done  he took them up  and turned them over in his\\r\\nhand  and wondered at their shape and workmanship “to morrow ” he said  “i will put them into the kiln  and see how they\\r\\ncome out  she certainly was a clever wench  and knew her work  but as\\r\\nfor her talk about having coloured them  that was all nonsense  and as\\r\\nfor breathing spells and charms into the cups  why it is like baby’s\\r\\ntalk ”but next day when the pots were baked  the potter was even more\\r\\nsurprised  for they had the most wonderful colours that he had ever\\r\\nseen  silver  blue  grey and yellow  in all sorts of patterns  all save\\r\\nthe little brown cup  which was the last the gipsy had made  but when\\r\\nhe looked at it the potter felt a little uncomfortable  and began to\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 88 \\r\\n\\r\\nwonder if it really did contain the charm as she had declared when the fair began  the potter placed all the gipsy’s wares on a stall\\r\\nwith his own  and marked them with very high prices  but had he asked\\r\\nthree times as much he could have got it  for there were some rich folk\\r\\nfrom the big houses who came to the fair  and they at once bought them\\r\\nall up  declaring that such pots and jugs they had never seen  at this\\r\\nthe potter was well pleased  and found that he had made more money than\\r\\nhe had earned in many a long month past  but when people wanted him to\\r\\nmake them more like them  he was obliged to shake his head  and say \\r\\n“that he was very sorry  but he had had them coloured from afar  and he\\r\\ndid not know where he could now have them done ” of the gipsy he saw\\r\\nnothing more  though he looked for her everywhere during the three days\\r\\nin which the fair lasted  but she was not to be seen  and when the fair\\r\\nwas over  and the other people were packing their carts and vans to go\\r\\non their way  he saw very many gipsies  and supposed that she had gone\\r\\nwith some of them  without giving him the chance of speaking to her\\r\\nagain  pg 89 years went by  and the potter never heard anything more of the gipsy \\r\\nindeed he would have thought it had all been a dream if it had not been\\r\\nfor the little brown pot standing on the shelf  sometimes he took it\\r\\nup  and looked at it  and wondered when he saw how well and cleverly it\\r\\nwas made  he still laughed when he remembered what the gipsy had said\\r\\nabout leaving a charm in it  for though he himself had drunk out of it\\r\\nmany times  he never thought it had brought any spell on him one year when the fair was being held  the potter was at his place\\r\\nas usual with his stall covered with pots  and there came and placed\\r\\nherself beside him at the next stall a woman with some spinning wheels \\r\\nher stall was covered with fine linen cloths woven in pretty patterns \\r\\nand so fine and well wrought were they  that many people wanted\\r\\nto buy them  with her were her two daughters  and one sat at the\\r\\nspinning wheel and spun the flax  and the other had a hand loom and\\r\\nwove it when it was spun to show the good folk how the cloths were\\r\\nmade  both were pretty girls  but the girl who had the hand loom had\\r\\nthe sweetest face the potter had ever seen  her eyes were very blue \\r\\n\\r\\n pg 90 \\r\\n\\r\\nand her hair was like golden corn  and when she smiled  it was as if\\r\\nthe sun shone  the potter watched her as she sat weaving  and could\\r\\nnot keep his eyes from her or attend properly to his own pots  or to\\r\\nthe people who wanted to buy them  every day he watched the young girl\\r\\nat her work  for the fair lasted for a week  and the more he looked at\\r\\nher the more he wanted to look  till at last he said to himself that\\r\\nsomehow or other he must get her for his wife  so when the fair was\\r\\ndone he begged her to marry him  and to remain with him  and he said he\\r\\nwould always work for her  and she should want for nothing  the mother\\r\\nwas a poor widow  and she and her daughters made their bread by going\\r\\nabout the country spinning and weaving  and she would have been quite\\r\\nwilling that the potter should marry her daughter  but the girl only\\r\\nlaughed  and said that she scarcely knew the potter  but when she came\\r\\nback again the next year to the fair  she would give him his answer  so\\r\\nthe widow and her two daughters went away  and no sign of them was left\\r\\nwith the potter  save a lock of golden hair  which he had begged from\\r\\nthe daughter  pg 91 the year passed away  but to the potter it seemed the longest year he\\r\\nhad ever lived  he pined for the time to come when the fair should\\r\\nbe held  and the widow and her daughters should return  as the time\\r\\ndrew near he got down the brown cup  and looked at it again and again \\r\\n“nay ” he said  “what harm could it do  the gipsy said it would give me\\r\\nmy true love’s heart if she drank out of it after i had drunk  and i\\r\\nhave drunk out of it many a time  i don’t believe it  but all the same\\r\\nit would be no harm for her to drink from it ”and so when the fair was opened  he took the brown cup down with him \\r\\nand stood it upon the stall with his other ware  the spinning woman and\\r\\nher two daughters came back with their fine cloths  and their wheel\\r\\nand their loom  and when he saw the golden haired girl  he loved her\\r\\nstill more than before  for he thought her eyes were bluer and her\\r\\nsmile was brighter  he watched her all the time as she sat weaving  but\\r\\nsaid nothing  but when the fair was over  and they were packing their\\r\\ngoods to go on their way  he pressed the maid for her answer  still\\r\\nshe hesitated  and then the potter took the little brown cup off his\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 92 \\r\\n\\r\\nstall  and poured into it some choice wine  and said to her “if then you wish to go away  and never see me again  i pray you drink\\r\\none draught  in remembrance of the happy days we have had together ”the young girl took the cup  but no sooner had she tasted it than she\\r\\nput it down and turned her eyes on the potter  and said in a low voice “i will stay with you always  if you want me  and will be a true wife\\r\\nto you  and love you better than anything on earth ”so the potter married her  and she went to live in his little cottage time passed  and the potter and his young wife lived together very\\r\\nhappily  and every day he thought her fairer and sweeter  and they had\\r\\na little baby girl with blue eyes like its mother’s  and the potter\\r\\nthought himself the happiest man on earth  and the little brown pot\\r\\nstood on the shelf  and the potter looked at it  and still he would not\\r\\nbelieve about the charm  for he said to himself  “my wife loved me for\\r\\nmy own sake  and not for any silly charm or nonsense ” pg 93 4  pg 95 so for a time all things went well  but there came a day when the\\r\\npotter had to go to a neighbouring town and leave his wife at home\\r\\nalone all day  when he was gone she sat by the window with her little\\r\\nchild  and presently there came up outside a dark  rough looking man \\r\\nwith a wicked face  and he looked at her as she sat rocking the cradle \\r\\nand thought she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen on earth \\r\\nwhen he looked at her the potter’s wife was frightened  but when he\\r\\ntold her he was very hungry  and begged her for food and drink  she\\r\\nrose  for her heart was tender  and she fetched him bread and meat  and\\r\\nspread them on the table before him  so the rough man came into the\\r\\ncottage and sat at the table  and ate the potter’s bread and meat  and\\r\\ndrank his wine  “and who is your husband  and where is he ” he said  “i\\r\\nam sure he is a lucky man to have such a wife and such a home ”“yes  truly ” said the potter’s wife  “we are very happy  and we love\\r\\neach other dearly  and we really have nothing else to wish for ”then the gipsy man said  “but your dress is plain  and your rooms are\\r\\nbare  now  were you the wife of some wealthy man  he would give you\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 96 \\r\\n\\r\\npearls and diamonds for your neck  and beautiful silks and satins ”“no  but i don’t want them ” said the potter’s wife smiling  “my\\r\\nhusband works very hard  and he gives me all he can  and i am quite\\r\\ncontent with it ”“and you say he is a potter  then what sort of things does he make ”\\r\\nasked the gipsy man as he cast his eyes about the room  and they lit\\r\\nupon the little brown jug standing upon the shelf  “and did he make the\\r\\nlittle bowl there ”“i don’t know ” said his wife  and she took it down and turned it about\\r\\nin her hand  “i suppose so  but he has told me it was very old ”the gipsy man seized it eagerly  and poured wine in it  and looked\\r\\ninside it  and then he laughed  and stooping his head over it  said a\\r\\nfew words  and then laughed again “i have seen cups like this before ” he said  “and they are worth a\\r\\nmint of money  though you would not think it  and have you never drunk\\r\\nout of it  has it not been used ”“i don’t drink from it ” said the potter’s wife  “but i believe i did\\r\\nso once  and that was on the day when i promised my husband i would be\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 97 \\r\\n\\r\\nhis wife ”then the gipsy laughed again and again  “see ” he said  “i am going a\\r\\nlong way off  perhaps to die by cold and hunger by the road side  while\\r\\nyou and your husband are cosy and warm  you set small store by this\\r\\ncup  but it may be that in foreign countries i could sell it for what\\r\\nwould keep me for many a long day  give it to me  i pray you  that i\\r\\nmay take it with me ”the potter’s wife hesitated and trembled  she was afraid of the man \\r\\nand she thought he had a hard  bad face  but she did not want to seem\\r\\nunkind “well  take it ” she said  “but why should you want it ”then the gipsy man came and caught her by the arm  “now ” he said \\r\\n“you are the fairest woman i have ever seen  and i am going away  and\\r\\nshall never see you again  so i beg you wish me god speed  and drink my\\r\\nhealth out of the little brown cup you have given me  and if your lips\\r\\nhave touched it  it will be the dearest thing i have on earth ” pg 98 then the potter’s wife was still more frightened  and trembled more\\r\\nthan before  but the man looked so dark and threatening  that she did\\r\\nnot like to refuse him  and she took the cup in her hand “and then you will go on your way ” she said “and then i shall go on my way ” cried the gipsy  “and you will wait\\r\\nhere till your husband comes  whom you love more than anything else on\\r\\nthis earth ”then the potter’s wife bent her head and tasted the wine out of the\\r\\ncup  and wished the gipsy happiness  and when she had done so he\\r\\nlaughed again  long and low  till her heart sank with fear  and he\\r\\npicked up the cup and put it into his bundle  and went his way  then\\r\\nthe potter’s wife sat down by the cradle  and almost cried  she knew\\r\\nnot why  and the whole room seemed cold  and when she looked out at the\\r\\nsunshine it looked dark  and she bent over the baby in the cradle with\\r\\nher tears falling “alack ” she cried  “why doesn’t my husband come home  where is he\\r\\ngone  how cruel it is to leave me all alone here  so that any rough\\r\\nman may come into the house  in truth i don’t think he can love me\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 99 \\r\\n\\r\\nmuch  since all he thinks of is to go away and leave me  and as for me \\r\\nsurely i could have had many a better husband  and one who should have\\r\\nloved me more  how foolish i was to marry him ”thus she sat and lamented all day  and in the evening  when the potter\\r\\ndrove up to his door and cried out “wife  wife ” she wouldn’t go out\\r\\nto receive him  and when he came in to their little sitting room  he\\r\\nfound her with tears in her eyes  sitting lamenting and complaining \\r\\nwhen he went up to her to take her in his arms and kiss her  she turned\\r\\naway from him and would not let him touch her  and the potter  who had\\r\\nnever seen his wife cross or angry  knew that there must be something\\r\\nwrong  she must be ill  he thought  to morrow or the next day she will\\r\\nbe well again  so he urged her to rest well  and took no notice of her\\r\\nangry words  but the next day  and the next  there was no change  and\\r\\nthings were growing from bad to worse  for now the wife wouldn’t speak\\r\\nto him at all  and when she came nigh him she looked at him with anger \\r\\nand would not even suffer him to touch the hem of her dress  then the\\r\\npotter began to think of the little brown cup  and he looked up at the\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nshelf and saw that it was not there  and he began to feel very much\\r\\nalarmed “why ” he said  “what has become of my little old brown cup that used\\r\\nto stand up on the shelf ”“i gave it to a gipsy man ” she answered scornfully  “he seemed to like\\r\\nit  and i didn’t see that i was obliged to keep all the rubbish that\\r\\nyou had in the house ”then the potter groaned within himself and said “but did you just take it off the shelf and give it to him  and did he\\r\\nask you for it  why did he want it ”“of course he asked for it ” said the wife very angrily  “and i just\\r\\ngave it him when i had drunk his health out of it  as he wished me to ”then the potter was stricken with deadly fear  and remembered the words\\r\\nof the gipsy  “the first draught she will drink to your love  and the\\r\\nsecond draught she will drink to your hate ” and he knew in his heart\\r\\nthat the words were true  and that the cup carried with it a charm he sat and thought and thought  and waited many days  hoping that his\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 101 \\r\\n\\r\\nwife would change  and love him as before  but she remained cold and\\r\\nhard  then the potter packed a wallet full of clothes  and put some\\r\\nmoney in his pocket  and he went to his wife and said  “wife  there is\\r\\na man somewhere who has done me a great wrong  and perhaps he did it\\r\\nunwittingly  i am going out to find him  and to make him right it  and\\r\\nthough you do not love me  you will bide here quietly with your baby\\r\\ntill i come back  and i do not know if that will be in months or in\\r\\nyears ” then the potter’s wife fell a crying  pg 102 “i do not love you  nay  i hate you  and shall be glad when you have\\r\\ngone  but perhaps it may be because i am a wicked woman  and i do not\\r\\nknow what has come over me  that now i want to fly away from you  when\\r\\ni used to think that i had the best husband on all this earth ” the\\r\\npotter sighed bitterly  but he kissed her cheeks  which felt as cold as\\r\\nice  and then he said good bye to his baby  and started on his way with\\r\\nthe tears filling his eyes when the potter had gone the wife cried sorely  but still she was glad\\r\\nthat she had not to see him  and for some time she lived with her baby\\r\\nhappily enough  she kept the house  and mended and swept and cleaned as\\r\\nbefore  and thought little of the potter or where he had gone  but by\\r\\nand by all her money began to be spent  and she knew that unless the\\r\\npotter returned she would soon be very poor  and the winter was coming\\r\\non  and she feared cold and hunger for her little one  so she went into\\r\\na garret where she kept her old weaving loom  and she brought it out \\r\\nand she bought flax  and sat down to weave just as she used to  when\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 103 \\r\\n\\r\\nshe went round the country with her sister who spun the flax  and she\\r\\nfound that she could still weave her cloths very skilfully  and she\\r\\nbegan to sell them to the passers by  and in this way she earned her\\r\\nbread the winter set in very cold and hard  and the potter’s wife felt very\\r\\nsad  “but perhaps ” she said  “it is thinking of the poor things\\r\\nwho are starving around with no homes ” for she never thought of\\r\\nher husband at all  and the flax began to be very dear  and she had\\r\\ndifficulty in buying it  “instead of doing all these cheap clothes ”\\r\\nshe said  “it would be better to get very fine flax  and do a very very\\r\\nfine cloth  it will be the finest cloth i have ever woven  and i will\\r\\nsell it to some very rich lady ” so she bought the finest flax that\\r\\nmoney could bring her  and when she had woven a little bit of it  she\\r\\nsat and looked at it in her room  and she saw a tress of her own golden\\r\\nhair lying upon it  and she thought how beautiful it looked  then she\\r\\nsaid—“there is no one now who loves me or my hair  so i will weave it into\\r\\na cloth with this very fine flax  and i must sell it for a very large\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 104 \\r\\n\\r\\nsum of money  or else i shall have nothing left to go on with ” but\\r\\nshe couldn’t think of any pattern in which the hair looked well with\\r\\nthe fine linen flax  till at last she hit on one in which there was a\\r\\ncup with a heart on the top of it  the cup she made of the gold hair \\r\\nand the heart also  she worked at it for many long days  and when she\\r\\nhad finished it she looked at it  and was very much pleased  and said\\r\\nindeed it was the most beautiful cloth she had ever made  and now she\\r\\nmust make haste and take it in to the town and sell it for a great deal\\r\\nof money  or she and her child would begin to do badly for food and\\r\\nfire the snow was lying heavily upon the ground  as the potter’s wife stood\\r\\nby the window looking at her cloth  when there crawled up outside the\\r\\nwindow a poor gipsy woman leading a little boy by the hand  she had\\r\\nbig black eyes and a brown face  but her cheeks were so thin that the\\r\\ncolour scarcely showed in them  and the potter himself would have had\\r\\nmuch ado to recognize her as the gipsy girl who made the cup years\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 105 \\r\\n\\r\\nbefore  and her clothes all hung upon her in rags  and her little boy\\r\\nwas crying bitterly with the cold  she knocked against the window with\\r\\nher poor thin hands  “take me in ” she cried  “and have pity on me \\r\\nfor i can go no further ” then the potter’s wife opened the door  and\\r\\nthe gipsy woman entered the room with her little boy by her side  and\\r\\ncrouched by the fire “where is the potter who lived here ” said the gipsy  “it is long years\\r\\nago since i saw him  and now i have come back to pray that he would\\r\\ngive me food  for i am starving ”“no ” said the wife  “i know not where he is  for he is my husband  and\\r\\nhe has left me  and right glad of it am i  but if you will stay here i\\r\\nwill give you food and drink and attend to you  for  poor woman  you\\r\\nseem to me to be very ill  so stay here and i will attend to you till\\r\\nyou are well enough to go your way ”“there is only one way that i shall ever go ” said the gipsy  and she\\r\\nlooked into the fire with her big black eyes  “and that is the road\\r\\nwhich leads to the churchyard  but if he was your husband  why do you\\r\\nsay that you are glad he is away  is he not kind to you ” pg 106 “he was very kind to me ” said the potter’s wife  “he gave me\\r\\neverything i wanted  and money and to spare  but for all that i could\\r\\nnot love him  and i am glad he has gone  and left me alone with my baby\\r\\ngirl ”“you are a foolish woman ” said the gipsy  “if you had a husband who\\r\\nloved you and worked for you well  you should have loved him and\\r\\ncherished him  my husband beat me  and was cruel to me  and stole all i\\r\\nhad  and now that i am dying  he has deserted me to die as i may ”then the potter’s wife brought her food and bid her lie down  and dried\\r\\nher rags of clothes  and she wrapped the little boy in her own clothes \\r\\nand gave him food and put him to sleep  and as she lay  the gipsy woman\\r\\nwatched her with her great black eyes  and at last she said  “have you\\r\\na brown cup here  a little rough brown cup  did your husband give it to\\r\\nyou ”the potter’s wife stared with astonishment  “how did you know i had a\\r\\nlittle rough brown cup ” she said  “there was such a one  and it stood\\r\\nupon the shelf  but i have given it away  i gave it to a poor gipsy man\\r\\nwho begged it of me  he wanted it so badly that i couldn’t refuse  and\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 107 \\r\\n\\r\\nhe made me drink his health in it ere he took it away ”then the gipsy woman raised her head  and her eyes looked blacker and\\r\\nher cheeks blacker “and what was the gipsy man like ” she cried  “had you drunk from the\\r\\ncup before  can you remember ”“i remember well ” said the woman  “i drank from it on the day when i\\r\\npromised i would marry my husband  and i drank from it once again when\\r\\ni wished the gipsy god speed  and soon after that  my husband left me \\r\\nfor i could not bear to have him near me ”then the gipsy cried out aloud  and said something in a language which\\r\\nthe woman did not understand  and beat her hands “i think it was my husband ” she said  “alack a day  to morrow night\\r\\ni shall die  and who will take care of my little boy  and see that he\\r\\ndoes not starve  for his father would beat and ill treat him if he\\r\\nfound him ” then the potter’s wife kneeled down beside the gipsy woman \\r\\nand kissed her on the forehead “be at peace ” she said  “if it be that you must die  die with a\\r\\nquiet heart  for i will keep your little boy  what is enough for two\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 108 \\r\\n\\r\\nis enough for three  and he shall call my little girl sister and me\\r\\nmother ”the gipsy said nothing  but she looked at the potter’s wife for long \\r\\nand then she said  “and my clothes are all in rags  and i have no\\r\\ngarment in which you can wrap me for my grave ”then the potter’s wife began to cry  “be at peace ” she said  “for i\\r\\nhave a fine cloth made of flax and my own hair  and in it you can lie\\r\\nclad like a princess ”then again the gipsy woman cried out words that the potter’s wife did\\r\\nnot understand  and again she beat her breast and lamented  but as\\r\\nevening drew nigh she turned to the potter’s wife  and told her all the\\r\\ntruth about the charms in the cup  and wept for the evil she had done\\r\\nher  who was so good and kind the potter’s wife sat by her all that day  and into the dark hours of\\r\\nthe night  but when it was drawing nigh to twelve o’clock the gipsy\\r\\nwoman sat up  and stretched out her arms  “the wheel ” she cried \\r\\n“bring me your husband’s wheel  and give me a piece of clay  that while\\r\\nthere is yet time i may throw my last cup  and you may drink from it\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 109 \\r\\n\\r\\nbefore the dawn and undo the harm i have worked ”the potter’s wife wondered much  but she feared to disobey her  and she\\r\\nwent out into her husband’s workshop  and she brought in his wheel and\\r\\na piece of clay which stood there  and placed them beside the gipsy \\r\\nthe gipsy was so weak that she could scarcely sit up  but when she saw\\r\\nthe wheel she staggered to her feet  and took the clay in her thin\\r\\nlittle brown hands  and moulded it as she had done years before  and\\r\\nthen she set it on the wheel  and set the wheel spinning  and formed it\\r\\ninto a little brown bowl  and bent her head over it  and whispered into\\r\\nit “now drink ” she cried  “although the clay is still wet  pour water\\r\\ninto it and drink from my little bowl  and wish me god speed as you did\\r\\nto my husband  and then dress me in white and gold like a princess  for\\r\\ni must start upon my journey  but keep my little boy always  and if my\\r\\nhusband comes to search for me  give him my ring  but tell him that he\\r\\nshall never find me more ”the potter’s wife poured some water into the little clay cup  and\\r\\nstooped her face and drank it  that the woman might be content  and\\r\\nwhen she had done so  the gipsy folded her hands and lay back and\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 110 \\r\\n\\r\\ndied  but when she had tasted the water out of the wet clay  the\\r\\npotter’s wife thought of her husband  and she called his name  and\\r\\ncried to him to come and help her with the poor gipsy woman  and then\\r\\nshe thought of how long it was since he had been with her  and she\\r\\nbegan to cry  and wept bitterly as she leant over the dead woman “oh  where is he gone  why did i drive him from me ” she said  “have\\r\\ni been mad  truly the poor gipsy spoke rightly  that if a woman has a\\r\\nhusband who loves her and works for her  she should cherish him with\\r\\nall her might  alas  alas  and now my husband is out in the wide world \\r\\nand i am alone here with no one to help me  until this poor woman told\\r\\nme  i never knew how wrong i was ” then she looked at the gipsy woman\\r\\nlying in all her rags  and she remembered her promise to her  and she\\r\\ntook the fine linen cloth in which was woven the gold heart and the\\r\\ngilt cup  and she clothed her in it as if she were a princess  and the\\r\\nnext day the poor woman was buried  and no one knew from whence she\\r\\ncame nor to whom she belonged  pg 111 then the potter’s wife sat down  and grieved bitterly  for she didn’t\\r\\nknow what it would be best to do to find her husband again  and tell\\r\\nhim that she loved him as at first  at first she thought she would go\\r\\nout and seek for him in the wide  wide world  but then she remembered\\r\\nhow he bid her wait where she was till he came back  and she knew she\\r\\nought to do what he had told her  but as now she had three to keep\\r\\ninstead of two  she feared they would be very poor  and as she had\\r\\nburied the gipsy in the fine gold and white cloth woven with her hair \\r\\nshe had not got it to sell  and she had not any money left wherewith\\r\\nto buy more fine thread to weave  the gipsy’s little boy was a pretty\\r\\nboy  with dark eyes like his mother’s  and when she looked at him she\\r\\nsaid they would all three starve together  but she would keep him  as\\r\\nshe had promised his mother  rather than turn him out into the cold\\r\\nstreets  so she washed him  and mended his rags as best she might  and\\r\\nthen she began to seek everywhere for something she might weave to\\r\\nsell  and keep them from starving  she wandered round the garden  and\\r\\nin and out of the house  and the gipsy boy  who was a clever  bright\\r\\nlad  went with her  pg 112 “what are you searching for ” he asked “i am searching for thread  that i may weave into some kind of cloth\\r\\nand sell ” she said  “otherwise we shall surely starve  for i have no\\r\\nmoney left to buy it with  and nothing more left to sell ”“i will go and get you something to weave ” said the boy  and he ran\\r\\nout into the road  and looked up and down it to see what would come\\r\\npast  presently there came up a big cart laden with straw  and on the\\r\\ntop of the cart lay one man  while another drove  the horses went\\r\\nslowly  and the gipsy boy followed them  and began to beg “run off  little chap ” cried the man at the top  “i have no money to\\r\\ngive to beggars ”“but i don’t ask you for money ” cried the boy  “but of your charity\\r\\ngive me a handful of straw ”“and what do you want with a handful of straw ” asked the carter  as\\r\\nthe boy still went on begging “why  see ” cried the lad  “i am all in rags  but if my mother had a\\r\\nhandful of straw she can weave me a coat  and i shall be quite warm ”\\r\\nat which the men both laughed  and declared that the idea of a coat\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 113 \\r\\n\\r\\nof straw was very funny  but the driver said  “well  give some to the\\r\\nlittle chap  i expect he comes from a lot of lying gipsies further on \\r\\nand they want it for their animals  still it won’t do any harm to give\\r\\nhim a few wisps ” and so they flung down a bundle  and the boy picked\\r\\nit up  and ran back with it to the potter’s wife “see what i have brought you ” he cried  “now make that into a mat  and\\r\\ni will take it out and sell it  and bring you back the money ”the potter’s wife was amazed by his cleverness  but she knew that the\\r\\ngipsies had to live by their wits  and that teaches them to be sharp \\r\\nso she sat down  and tried to weave the straw into a mat  as the gipsy\\r\\nboy had said at first she found it very hard to use  for it was coarse and brittle \\r\\nand she thought she could make nothing of it  the lad sat beside her \\r\\nand cut it into even lengths for her  and chose out the good pieces \\r\\nand at last betwixt them it was done  and it looked quite a smart\\r\\nlittle mat  and the boy took it on his back and ran away with it to the\\r\\nvillage  pg 114 “a mat  a mat ” he cried  “who wants to buy a good straw mat to wipe\\r\\ntheir feet on when they are dirty  or for the cat to sit on by the\\r\\nfire  or to put over the fowl house and keep it warm ”at first all the people he met laughed at him  and said nobody wished\\r\\nto buy a mat at all  then he turned into the ale house  there were\\r\\nsome men smoking and keeping themselves warm by the fire  and when the\\r\\nhost saw him  and the mat over his shoulder  he said it was quite a\\r\\nwell made thing  and he would have it to lay down by his doorway for\\r\\nin comers to tread on  and then one and another looked at it  and the\\r\\nboy told them where it came from  and said he could bring them plenty\\r\\nmore straw mats and carpets  all as good or better  and so well worked\\r\\nthat they would last almost for ever  and presently one and another\\r\\nbegan to say that they would buy them  and when he had taken his money \\r\\nthe gipsy boy ran home well content so the potter’s wife sat all day weaving straw mats  and presently she\\r\\ngot to do them so well  that from far and near the people sent to buy\\r\\nthem of her  then after a time she put patterns into them  made with\\r\\nred  and black  and white straws  but do what she could  the patterns\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 115 \\r\\n\\r\\nalways came out in the shape of a cup  and still she wept and grieved\\r\\nall day long  then the gipsy lad said to her—“what are you crying for now  you have plenty to eat and drink  tell me\\r\\nwhy you are crying  and i will help you if i can  because you took my\\r\\nmother into your house to die  and buried her in your fine cloth like a\\r\\nprincess ”“i cry because my husband has gone a long way off ” said the potter’s\\r\\nwife  “and he doesn’t know that i love him  and he will never come back\\r\\nto me  for when he went away i hated him ”“he will never know it if you don’t try to tell him ” said the gipsy\\r\\nboy  “you should tell it to every one you meet  to all the birds of the\\r\\nair  and the wild animals too  that is what my mother told me to do \\r\\nif i wanted to send news abroad  you should say it even to the winds \\r\\nand write it in the sand  and on the earth  and on the leaves of the\\r\\ntrees in case they blow about  for she said all things could pass on a\\r\\nsecret  though none can keep one  and why don’t you weave it into your\\r\\nmats too  for the people who buy them take them far and near  and maybe\\r\\nhe will see one  and know that you want him to come home again ” pg 116 then the potter’s wife tried to weave her secret into her mats  and\\r\\nbeside the pattern of the cup she wove a little verse—“now ” cried the gipsy boy  “your husband may see it  and perhaps he\\r\\nwill come home  and all will be well with us ”but still the potter journeyed far into the world  and wherever he went\\r\\nhe asked if any gipsy had been near there  and if there happened to be\\r\\na gipsy camp in the neighbourhood  he went to it at once  and asked\\r\\nfor a gipsy woman with red beads and gold chains in her hair  or for a\\r\\ngipsy man who carried a brown cup with him  but though he saw hundreds\\r\\nof gipsies  yet he never again saw the girl who had thrown the cup \\r\\nand none of the men knew anything about the man  nor could tell him\\r\\nanything about the little brown bowl  then he went to the shops in the\\r\\nbig towns where jars and bowls are sold  and asked for a cup that had\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 117 \\r\\n\\r\\na spell in it  for he thought if they sold such a one  they might know\\r\\nhow to help him to undo the work of the gipsy’s bowl  but everywhere\\r\\nthe people only laughed at him so he went through strange countries  seeing strange things  but none\\r\\nof them gave him any pleasure  since he was always thinking of his wife\\r\\nat home  then he returned to his native land  and pondered whether he\\r\\nshould go back to his own cottage  but his heart failed him  and he\\r\\nkept far from the little village where it stood “it would be little use to go home ” he said  “for if my wife is not\\r\\nglad to see me  it is no home to me  and she will not be glad to see me\\r\\ntill i can find the gipsy and know how the charm can be broken ”one night he went into a booth where there were a number of men\\r\\ndrinking  and amongst them there was one who looked like a gipsy  a\\r\\ndark  savage looking fellow who was talking loud  and boasting much\\r\\nof all he had done  the potter sat and listened to their talk  and\\r\\npresently they began quarrelling  and talking about who was the most\\r\\nbeautiful woman in the world  the gipsy cried out that he knew the\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 118 \\r\\n\\r\\nmost beautiful  and that she had given him a parting gift and wished\\r\\nhim god speed  and now he was going back to her  for he knew now the\\r\\nway to make her love him  and he meant to wed her and have her for his\\r\\nwife upon this the others laughed and jeered  and said  was it likely that\\r\\nsuch a beautiful woman would care for such a rough  ill favoured fellow\\r\\nas he  and declared they didn’t think much of her beauty if she was\\r\\nwilling to marry him and to be his wife then another man standing near said that he knew where lived the most\\r\\nbeautiful woman on the face of the earth  though he did not believe\\r\\nthat she would ever be wife of his  still all the same it would be hard\\r\\nto beat her for loveliness  and she was a clever worker too  for she it\\r\\nwas who worked the mats that lay under his feet in the cart he drove \\r\\nupon this they all began to wrangle  and their words grew high “and if the beautiful woman loved you so ” cried one man to the gipsy \\r\\n“how could you come away and leave her ”the gipsy laughed  “she didn’t love me then ” he said  “but she will\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 119 \\r\\n\\r\\nnow  for i am taking her a charm which will make her love me more than\\r\\nany one on earth  she has only to drink out of the cup i carry here \\r\\nand she will be mine for life ”upon this they all laughed  and derided him still more “then let every one believe that what i say is true ” cried the gipsy \\r\\nand from his bosom he took out a small brown bowl and waved it in the\\r\\nair  “and here is the cup to prove it ” and the potter’s heart almost\\r\\nstood still  for he recognized the cup which the gipsy girl had made\\r\\nfor him years before the other man laughed scornfully  “that proves nothing ” he said  “i\\r\\nmight take the mat out from the cart and ask it to say if i spoke the\\r\\ntruth  but mats and cups have no tongues to speak with  though my mat\\r\\ncan say more than your cup  for there is a rhyme on it with a pattern\\r\\nof a cup  moreover  the rhyme is about a gipsy too ”“let us see it ” cried they all then the man went out to his cart and fetched in a white and brown\\r\\nstraw mat  covered with a pattern made of cups  and he read the rhyme\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 120 \\r\\n\\r\\nwhich was written upon it—on hearing this the potter jumped up  and dashed into their midst  and\\r\\nseized the cup “the gipsy speaks truth ” he cried  “when he says she is the most\\r\\nbeautiful woman in the world  but he speaks false when he says that she\\r\\nwill ever love him  for he has stolen that cup  and i shall take it\\r\\nfrom him  and if he tries to stop me  why then i will fight him  and\\r\\nlet every one see who is the better fellow of the two ”but when the gipsy had seen the rhyme upon the mat  he stood and stared\\r\\nas if he were made of stone  and said no word to the potter  and indeed\\r\\nscarcely seemed to notice that he had taken away the cup from him  then\\r\\nthe potter turned to the man who owned the mat and said  “if you will\\r\\nsell me your mat i will pay you handsomely for it  and i beg you to\\r\\ntell me who made it  and where you got it  for i would like to buy some\\r\\nmore like it ” pg 121 the traveller was much astonished  but he told the potter that it was\\r\\nmade by a woman who lived in a village a little way off  and she sat by\\r\\nher doorway and wove mats  with a gipsy boy to help her  and she was\\r\\nthe loveliest woman he had ever seen on earth  with eyes just like blue\\r\\ncornflowers and hair like golden corn  then the potter took his bowl\\r\\nand the mat and started to go home  but the gipsy slunk out of the room\\r\\nand went into the night  and nobody noticed him meantime the potter’s wife continued to grieve and lament  for in spite\\r\\nof her taking the gipsy boy’s advice  and telling all things that she\\r\\nloved her husband and wished him back  he did not come back to her  and\\r\\nthough she wove her rhyme into every mat that she made  she despaired\\r\\nof the potter’s ever seeing one  the only thing which seemed to console\\r\\nher  was the little brown clay cup that the gipsy woman had thrown for\\r\\nher  before she died  as it had never been baked in the oven  the clay\\r\\nwas dry and hard and cracked  and it was a sorry thing to look at  but\\r\\nstill the potter’s wife kept it beside her  and would drink out of\\r\\nnothing else  and from time to time she kissed it  and laid her cheek\\r\\nagainst it  pg 122 the gipsy boy said to her—“if i were you i should watch for my husband all day  i would weave my\\r\\nmats in the doorway  and look up the road both ways  from morn till\\r\\nnight  otherwise your husband will come back and go past the cottage\\r\\nand you will never know ” so she took her loom and sat by the roadway \\r\\nand watched  and looked over the hill and to right and left for whoever\\r\\nmight come  and often the gipsy boy would watch too  and look from the\\r\\nother side of the cottage while the potter’s wife sat in the front  one\\r\\nday the gipsy boy ran round to her and said  “there is some one coming\\r\\nup the road who will come here  but it is not your husband  it is my\\r\\nfather  and he will want to take me away  and he will beat me as he did\\r\\nmy mother  and if he gets hold of the cup that my mother made for you \\r\\nhe knows all her charms  and he can undo what she did  and perhaps can\\r\\nthrow some evil spell on us all  so that your husband will never return\\r\\nagain  so the best thing will be for you to give me the cup and let me\\r\\nhide myself with it  and then you must tell him that you do not know\\r\\nwhere i am  and if he asks  tell him that the cup is gone  and when he\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 123 \\r\\n\\r\\nis gone i will come back again  but promise that you will not give me\\r\\nup to him ”so the potter’s wife promised that she would never give up the little\\r\\nboy  and she bid him take the cup and run quickly and hide himself  and\\r\\nthen she took her little girl by the hand and sat and waited for the\\r\\ngipsy man to come  though she trembled with fear  and wished him far\\r\\naway presently the gipsy man came up to the front of the cottage where the\\r\\npotter’s wife sat  and bid her good day “i was here before ” he said  “and you gave me something to eat and\\r\\ndrink  is your husband come back  for he was away then ”“my husband is away still ” she said  “but soon i hope he will be here ”then the gipsy took up one of her mats which lay on the ground beside\\r\\nher  and looked at it “you are clever with your loom ” he said  “but what do you mean by the\\r\\nlittle verse you put on all these mats ”“it is a little verse which can but be rightly read by one person ”\\r\\nshe answered  “and if he sees it  it will not matter whether others\\r\\nunderstand it or no ” pg 124 “and have you been here all alone since i came by ” asked the gipsy \\r\\n“have no other gipsies been past  for i want to join some of my own\\r\\npeople  and perhaps you can tell me which way they are gone ”“one came not so long ago ” answered the potter’s wife  “but she was\\r\\nso tired with tramping far that she could go no further  so she has\\r\\nstayed  and rests in the churchyard  she was a gipsy woman with red\\r\\nbeads and coins in her hair  and i kept her and let her die in peace \\r\\nand wrapped her in a cloth of white and gold ”“and did she do nothing while she rested here ” asked the gipsy man \\r\\n“did she make you no present to pay you for your trouble ”“she made me a present which paid me for my trouble well ” said the\\r\\nwoman  “though it was only a little cup of clay that was grey and wet \\r\\nand she gave me this ring  and bid me give it to her husband if he came\\r\\nby here  and tell him that it was useless for him to seek her further ”the gipsy man looked at the ring she held out to him  and he turned\\r\\npale  and knit his brows “and where is that cup ” he asked  “and where is her little boy  for i\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 125 \\r\\n\\r\\nwill take him with me into the world ”“i don’t know where he is gone ” said the potter’s wife  “as for the\\r\\ncup  he took it with him when he went ”meantime the gipsy boy had hidden in a hay stack quite close to the\\r\\ncottage  from where he could see the roadways all round  and he looked\\r\\nto right and left for who should pass  for he was still half afraid\\r\\nthat his father might come and search for him  and take him away by\\r\\nforce  as he lay and watched he saw a man coming over the hill  who\\r\\nlooked spent and tired  as if he had walked far  he seemed to know the\\r\\npath well  and he came straight to the cottage  but he did not come in \\r\\nbut waited near as if he wanted to see who was there  then the gipsy\\r\\nboy said to himself—“perhaps this is the potter himself  whom she has been looking for all\\r\\nthis time ” so he slid down and ran to the man and began to pretend to\\r\\nbeg the man looked at him and said—“you are a gipsy’s child  where do you come from  are you living under\\r\\na hedge  or do you come from a gipsy’s camp near ” pg 126 “it is true i am a gipsy’s child ” answered the boy  “but i am living\\r\\nunder no hedge  but in that little cottage  for the woman who lives\\r\\nthere keeps me for love of my mother  who helped her when she was in\\r\\ntrouble ”“and what did your mother do for the woman ” asked the man  who was no\\r\\nother than the potter  “it must have been a great service  that she\\r\\nshould be willing to take you and keep you ”“she saved her from an evil charm that had been cast upon her ”\\r\\nanswered the boy  “and taught her to love her husband again  and she\\r\\nwaits his return now and longs for him to come  therefore she promised\\r\\nto keep me with her  but now i dare not go into the cottage  because my\\r\\nfather  who is a gipsy  is there  and i am afraid lest he may take me\\r\\naway with him ”when the potter heard that the gipsy man was there he would have run\\r\\nstraight into the cottage  but the boy implored him to listen first\\r\\nand hear what he was saying  so they crept round to the side of the\\r\\ncottage  and they heard the gipsy man growing angry  and threatening\\r\\nthe potter’s wife  that if she did not tell him where his boy had gone\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 127 \\r\\n\\r\\nhe would seize her by the hair and wring her throat  in spite of her\\r\\nbeing so fair a woman  at this the potter waited no longer  but burst\\r\\ninto the cottage  and seized the gipsy and hurled him out of the house\\r\\nwith all his might  but he and his wife never looked to see if he was\\r\\nhurt or no  for they looked at nothing but each other and the little\\r\\nchild that the potter’s wife held by the hand  and the gipsy man went\\r\\naway  and they never heard of him again then the potter’s wife showed her husband the gipsy boy  and told him\\r\\nof her promise to his mother  and of all he had done for her  and\\r\\nbegged him that he would let her keep him with them  and the potter\\r\\npromised that she should  and said that when he grew up to be a man he\\r\\nwould teach him his trade  and make him a potter like himself  so they\\r\\nall lived happily together  and the gipsy boy learned to make cups and\\r\\nbowls  and was very clever at doing them  but they were cups and bowls\\r\\nthat carried no charms with them  and so could do no one any harm that\\r\\ndrank from them  pg 128 \\nonce there lived\\r\\nan old gentleman who was a very rich old gentleman \\r\\nand able to buy nearly everything he wanted  he had earned all his\\r\\nwealth for himself by trading in a big city  and now he had grown so\\r\\nfond of money that he loved it better than anything else in the world \\r\\nand thought of nothing except how he could save it up and make more \\r\\nbut he never seemed to have time to enjoy himself with all that he had\\r\\nearned  and he was very angry if he was asked to give money to others \\r\\nhe lived in a handsome house all alone  and he had a very good cook who\\r\\ncooked him a sumptuous dinner every day  but he rarely asked any one\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 129 \\r\\n\\r\\nto share it with him  though he loved eating and drinking  and always\\r\\nhad the best of wine and food  his cook and his other servants knew\\r\\nthat he was greedy and hard  and cared for nobody  and though they\\r\\nserved him well because he paid them  they none of them loved him it was one christmas  and the snow lay thick upon the ground  and the\\r\\nwind howled so fiercely that the old gentleman was very glad he was not\\r\\nobliged to go out into the street  but could sit in his comfortable\\r\\narm chair by the fire and keep warm “it really is terrible weather ” he said to himself  “terrible\\r\\nweather ” and he went to the window and looked out into the street \\r\\nwhere all the pavements were inches deep in snow  “i am very glad that\\r\\ni need not go out at all  but can sit here and keep warm for to day \\r\\nthat is the great thing  and i shall have some ado to keep out the cold\\r\\neven here with the fire ”he was leaving the window  when there came up in the street outside\\r\\nan old man  whose clothes hung in rags about him  and who looked half\\r\\nfrozen  he was about the same age as the old gentleman inside the\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 130 \\r\\n\\r\\nwindow  and the same height  and had grey  curly hair  like his  and\\r\\nif they had been dressed alike any one would have taken them for two\\r\\nbrothers “oh  really ” said the old gentleman irritably  “this is most annoying \\r\\nthe parish ought to take up these sort of people  and prevent their\\r\\nwandering about the streets and molesting honest folk ” for the poor\\r\\nold man had taken off his hat  and began to beg “it is christmas day ” he said  and though he did not speak very loud \\r\\nthe old gentleman could hear every word he said quite plainly through\\r\\nthe window  “it is christmas day  and you will have your dinner here in\\r\\nyour warm room  of your charity give me a silver shilling that i may go\\r\\ninto an eating shop  and have a dinner too ”“a silver shilling ” cried the old gentleman  “i never heard of such a\\r\\nthing  monstrous  go away  i never give to beggars  and you must have\\r\\ndone something very wicked to become so poor ”but still the old man stood there  though the snow was falling on his\\r\\nshoulders  and on his bare head  “then give me a copper ” he said \\r\\n“just one penny  that to day i may not starve ” pg 131 “certainly not ” cried the old gentleman  “i tell you i never give to\\r\\nbeggars at all ” but the old man did not move “then ” he said  “give me some of the broken victuals from your table \\r\\nthat i may creep into a doorway and eat a christmas dinner there ”“i will give you nothing ” cried the old gentleman  stamping his foot \\r\\n“go away  go away at once  or i shall send for the policeman to take\\r\\nyou away ”the old beggar man put on his hat and turned quietly away  but what\\r\\nthe old gentleman thought was very odd was  that instead of seeming\\r\\ndistressed he was laughing merrily  and then he looked back at the\\r\\nwindow  and called out some words  but they were in a foreign tongue \\r\\nand the old gentleman could not understand them  so he returned to his\\r\\ncomfortable arm chair by the fire  still murmuring angrily that beggars\\r\\nought not to be allowed to be in the streets next morning the snow fell more thickly than ever  and the streets were\\r\\nalmost impassable  but it did not trouble the old gentleman  for he\\r\\nknew he need not go out and get wet or cold  but in the morning when he\\r\\ncame down to breakfast  to his great surprise there was a cat on the\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 132 \\r\\n\\r\\nhearthrug in front of the fire  looking into it  and blinking lazily \\r\\nnow the old gentleman had never had any animal in his house before \\r\\nand he at once went to it and said “shoo shoo ” and tried to turn it\\r\\nout  but the cat did not move  and when the old gentleman looked at it\\r\\nnearer  he could not help admiring it very much  it was a very large\\r\\ncat  grey and black  and had extremely long soft hair  and a thick soft\\r\\nruff round its neck  moreover  it looked very well fed and cared for \\r\\nand as if it had always lived in comfortable places  somehow it seemed\\r\\nto the old gentleman to suit the room and the rug and the fire  and to\\r\\nmake the whole place look more prosperous and cosy even than it had\\r\\ndone before “a fine creature  a very handsome cat ” he said to himself  “i should\\r\\nreally think that a reward would be offered for such an animal  as it\\r\\nhas evidently been well looked after and fed  so it would be a pity to\\r\\nturn it away in a hurry ”one thing struck him as very funny about the cat  and that was that\\r\\nthough the ground was deep in snow and slush outside  the cat was quite\\r\\ndry  and its fur looked as if it had just been combed and brushed \\r\\n\\r\\n pg 133 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe old gentleman called to his cook and asked if she knew how the cat\\r\\nhad come in  but she declared she had not seen it before  and said\\r\\nshe believed it must have come down the chimney as all the doors and\\r\\nwindows had been shut and bolted  however  there it was  and when his\\r\\nown breakfast was finished the old gentleman gave it a large saucer of\\r\\nmilk  which it lapped up not greedily or in a hurry  but as if it were\\r\\nquite used to good food and had had plenty of it always “it really is a very handsome animal  and most uncommon ” said the\\r\\nold gentleman  “i shall keep it awhile and look out for the reward ”\\r\\nbut though he looked at all the notices in the street and in the\\r\\nnewspapers  the old gentleman could see no notice about a reward being\\r\\noffered for a grey and black cat  so it stayed on with him from day to\\r\\nday every day the cat seemed to his master to grow handsomer and handsomer \\r\\nthe old gentleman never loved anything but himself  but he began to\\r\\ntake a sort of interest in the strange cat  and to wonder what sort\\r\\nit was—if it was a persian or a siamese  or some curious new sort of\\r\\nwhich he had never heard  he liked the sound of its lazy contented\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 134 \\r\\n\\r\\npurring after its food  which seemed to speak of nothing but comfort\\r\\nand affluence  so the cat remained on till nearly a year had passed\\r\\naway it was not very long before christmas that an acquaintance of the old\\r\\ngentleman’s came to his rooms on business  he knew a great deal about\\r\\nall sorts of animals and loved them for their own sakes  but of course\\r\\nhe had never talked to the old gentleman about them  because he knew he\\r\\ndid not love anything  but when he saw the grey cat  he said at once—“do you know that this is a very valuable creature  and i should think\\r\\nwould be worth a great deal ”at these words the old gentleman’s heart beat high  here  he thought \\r\\nwould be a piece of great luck if a stray cat could make him richer\\r\\nthan he was before “why  who would want to buy it ” he said  “i don’t know anybody who\\r\\nwould be so foolish as to give any money for a cat which is of no\\r\\nuse in life except to catch mice  when you can so easily get one for\\r\\nnothing ” pg 135 “ah  but many people are very fond of cats  and would give much for\\r\\nrare sorts like this  if you want to sell it  the right thing would\\r\\nbe to send it to the cat show  and there you would most likely take a\\r\\nprize for it  and then some one would be sure to buy it  and  it may\\r\\nbe  would give a great deal  i don’t know what kind it is  or where it\\r\\ncomes from  for i have never seen one the least like it  but for that\\r\\nreason it is very sure to be valuable ”upon this the old gentleman almost laughed with joy “where is the cat show ” he asked  “and when is it to be held ”“there will be a cat show in this city quite soon ” said his\\r\\nacquaintance  “and it will be a particularly good one  for the new\\r\\nprincess is quite crazy about cats  and she is coming to it  and it is\\r\\nsaid that she doesn’t mind what she gives for a cat if she sees one she\\r\\nlikes ”so then he told the old gentleman how he should send his name and the\\r\\ncat’s name to the people who managed the show  and where it was to be\\r\\nheld  and went away  leaving the old gentleman well pleased  but to\\r\\nhimself he laughed and said  “i don’t think that old man thinks of\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 136 \\r\\n\\r\\nanything on earth but making money  how pleased he was at the idea of\\r\\nselling that beautiful cat if he could get something for it ”when he had gone  the grey puss came and rubbed itself about his\\r\\nmaster’s legs  and looked up in his face as though it had understood\\r\\nthe conversation  and did not like the idea of being sent to the show \\r\\nbut the old gentleman was delighted  and sat by the fire and mused on\\r\\nwhat he was likely to get for the cat  and wondered if it would not\\r\\ntake a prize “i shall be sorry to have to send it away ” he said  “still  if i could\\r\\nget a good round sum of money it would be a real sin not to take it  so\\r\\nyou will have to go  puss  and it really was extraordinary good luck\\r\\nfor me that you ever came here ”the days passed  and christmas day came  and again the snow fell  and\\r\\nthe ground was white  the wind whistled and blew  and on christmas\\r\\nmorning the old gentleman stood and looked out of the window at the\\r\\nfalling snow and rain  and the grey cat stood beside him  and rubbed\\r\\nitself against his hand  he rather liked stroking it  it was so soft\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 137 \\r\\n\\r\\nand comfortable  and when he touched the long hair he always thought of\\r\\nhow much money he should get for it this morning he saw no old beggar man outside the window  and he said\\r\\nto himself  “i really think they manage better with the beggars than\\r\\nthey used to  and are clearing them from the town ”but just as he was leaving the window he heard something scratching\\r\\noutside  and there crawled on to the window sill another cat  it was\\r\\na very different creature to the grey cat on the rug  it was a poor \\r\\nthin  wretched looking animal  with ribs sticking through its fur  and\\r\\nit mewed in the most pathetic manner  and beat itself against the pane \\r\\nwhen it saw it  the handsome grey puss was very much excited  and ran\\r\\nto and fro  and purred loudly “oh you disgraceful looking beast ” said the old gentleman angrily \\r\\n“go away  this is not the place for an animal like you  there is\\r\\nnothing here for stray cats  and you look as if you had not eaten\\r\\nanything for months  how different to my puss here ” and he tapped\\r\\nagainst the window to drive it away  but still it would not go  and\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 138 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe old gentleman felt very indignant  for the sound of its mewing was\\r\\nterrible  so he opened the window  and though he did not like to touch\\r\\nthe miserable animal  he took it up and hurled it away into the snow \\r\\nand it trotted away  and in the deep snow he could not see the way it\\r\\nwent but that evening  after he had had his christmas dinner  as he sat by\\r\\nthe fire with the grey puss on the hearthrug beside him  he heard again\\r\\nthe noise outside the window  and then he heard the stray cat crying\\r\\nand mewing to be let in  and again the grey and black cat became very\\r\\nmuch excited  and dashed about the room  and jumped at the window as if\\r\\nit wanted to open it “i shall really be quite glad when i have sold you at the cat show ”\\r\\nsaid the old gentleman  “if i am going to have all sorts of stray cats\\r\\nworrying here ” and for the second time he opened the window  and\\r\\nseized the trembling  half starved creature  and this time he threw\\r\\nit with all his might as hard as he could throw  “and now there is an\\r\\nend of you  i hope ” he said as he heard it fall with a dull thud  and\\r\\nsettled himself again in his arm chair  and the grey puss returned to\\r\\nthe hearthrug  but it did not purr or rub itself against its master  pg 139 next morning when he came down to breakfast  the old gentleman poured\\r\\nout a saucer of milk for his cat as usual  “you must be well fed if you\\r\\nare going to be shown at the show ” he said  “and i must not mind a\\r\\nlittle extra expense to make you look well  it will all be paid back \\r\\nso this morning you shall have some fish as well as your milk ” then he\\r\\nput the saucer of milk down by the cat  but it never touched it  but\\r\\nsat and looked at the fire with its tail curled round it “oh  well  if you have had so much already that you don’t want it  you\\r\\ncan take it when you do ” so he went away to his work and left the\\r\\nsaucer of milk by the fire  but when he came back in the evening there\\r\\nwas the saucer of milk and the piece of fish  and the grey cat had not\\r\\ntouched them  “this is rather odd ” said the old gentleman  “however  i\\r\\nsuppose cook has been feeding you ”next morning it was just the same  when he poured out the milk the cat\\r\\nwouldn’t lap it  but sat and looked at the fire  the old gentleman felt\\r\\na little anxious  for he fancied that the animal’s fur did not look\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nso bright as usual  and when in the evening and the next day and the\\r\\nnext  it would not lap its milk  or even smell the nice pieces of fish\\r\\nhe gave it  he was really uncomfortable  “the creature is getting ill ”\\r\\nhe said  “and this is most provoking  what will be the use of my having\\r\\nkept it for a year  if now i cannot show it ” he scolded his cook\\r\\nfor having given it unwholesome food  but the cook swore it had had\\r\\nnothing  anyhow it was growing terribly thin  and all day long it sat\\r\\nin front of the fire with its tail hanging down  not curled up neatly\\r\\nround it  and its coat looked dull and began to come out in big tufts\\r\\nof hair “now really i shall have to do something ” said the old gentleman \\r\\n“it is enough to make any one angry  no one would believe that this\\r\\ncould be a prize cat  it looks almost as wretched as that stray beast\\r\\nthat came to the window on christmas day ” so he went to a cat and\\r\\ndog doctor  who lived near  and asked him to come in and see a very\\r\\nbeautiful cat which had nothing the matter with it  but which refused\\r\\nto eat its food  the cat’s doctor came and looked at the cat  and then\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 141 \\r\\n\\r\\nlooked very grave  and shook his head  and looked at it again “i don’t know what sort of cat it is ” he said  “for i never saw any\\r\\nother like it  but it is a very handsome beast  and must be very\\r\\nvaluable  well  i will leave you some physic for it  and i hope you may\\r\\nbe able to pull it round  but with these foreign cats you never know\\r\\nwhat ails them  and they are hard to cure ”now the day was close at hand when the cat should have been sent to the\\r\\nshow  and the old gentleman was getting more and more uneasy  for the\\r\\ngrey cat lay upon the rug all day and never moved  and its ribs could\\r\\nalmost be seen through its side  so thin had it grown  and oddly enough\\r\\nthe old gentleman  who had never cared for any one or anything in his\\r\\nlife except himself  began to feel very unhappy  not only because of\\r\\nnot getting the money  but because he did not like to think of losing\\r\\nthe cat itself  he sent for his friend who had first told him about the\\r\\ncat show  and asked his advice  but his friend could not tell him what\\r\\nto do with it “well  well ” he said  “this is a bad business  for i have told every\\r\\none that you are going to exhibit a most extraordinarily beautiful\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 142 \\r\\n\\r\\ncat  and now this poor creature is really fit for nothing but the\\r\\nknacker’s yard  i think  maybe  some naturalist would give you a good\\r\\nprice for its skin  as it is so very uncommon  and if i were you i\\r\\nshould kill it at once  for if it dies a natural death its skin won’t\\r\\nbe worth a brass farthing ” at these words the grey cat lifted its\\r\\nhead  and looked straight into the old gentleman’s face  as if it\\r\\ncould understand  and for the first time for many a long year  the old\\r\\ngentleman felt a feeling of pity in his heart  and was angry with his\\r\\nfriend for his suggestion “i won’t have it killed ” he cried  “why  i declare  though it does\\r\\nseem absurd  i have lived with this creature for a year  and i feel as\\r\\nif it were my friend  and if it would only get well and sit up on the\\r\\nhearthrug  i shouldn’t mind about the money one bit ”at this his friend was greatly astonished  and went away wondering \\r\\nwhile the old gentleman sat by the fire and watched the cat lying\\r\\npanting on the rug “poor pussy  poor old pussy ” he said  “it is a pity that you can’t\\r\\nspeak and tell me what you want  i am sure i would give it to you ”\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 143 \\r\\n\\r\\njust as he spoke there came a noise outside  and he heard a mewing  and\\r\\nlooking through the window he saw the same thin ugly brown cat that\\r\\nhad come there last christmas  and it looked as thin and wretched as\\r\\never  when she heard the sound the grey cat stood up on her tottering\\r\\nfeet and tried to walk to the window  this time the old gentleman did\\r\\nnot drive it away  but looked at it  and almost felt sorry for it  it\\r\\nlooked almost as thin and ill as his own grey puss “you are an ugly brute ” he said  “and i don’t want you always hanging\\r\\nabout  still  maybe you would be none the worse for a little milk now \\r\\nand it might make you look better ” so he opened the window a little \\r\\nand then he shut it and then he opened it again  and this time the\\r\\nbrown cat crawled into the room  and went straight to the hearthrug to\\r\\nthe grey puss  there was a big saucer of milk on the hearthrug  and the\\r\\nbrown cat began to lap it at once  and the old gentleman never stopped\\r\\nit he thought as he watched it  that it grew fatter under his eyes as it\\r\\ndrank  and when the saucer was empty he took a jug and gave it some\\r\\nmore  “i really am an old fool ” he said  “that is a whole pennorth\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 144 \\r\\n\\r\\nof milk ” no sooner had he poured out the fresh milk than the grey\\r\\ncat raised itself  and sitting down by the saucer began to lap it as\\r\\nwell  as if it were quite well  the old gentleman stared with surprise \\r\\n“well  this is the queerest thing ” he said  so he took some fish and\\r\\ngave it to the strange cat  and then  when he offered some to his own\\r\\npuss  it ate it as if there was nothing the matter  “this is most\\r\\nremarkable ” said the old gentleman  “perhaps it was the company of a\\r\\ncreature of its own sort that my cat needed  after all ” and the grey\\r\\ncat purred and began to rub itself against his legs so for the next few days the two cats lay together on the hearthrug \\r\\nand though it was too late to send the grey cat to the show  the old\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 145 \\r\\n\\r\\ngentleman never thought about it  so pleased was he that it had got\\r\\nwell again but seven nights after the stray cat had come in from outside  as the\\r\\nold gentleman lay asleep in bed at night  he felt something rub itself\\r\\nagainst his face  and heard his cat purring softly  as though it wanted\\r\\nto say “good bye ” “be quiet  puss  and lie still till the morning ” he\\r\\nsaid  but when he came down to have his breakfast in the morning  there\\r\\nsat the brown tabby  looking fat and comfortable by the fire  but the\\r\\ngrey cat was not there  and though they looked for it everywhere  no\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 146 \\r\\n\\r\\none could find it  though all the windows and doors had been shut  so\\r\\nthey could not think how it could have got away  the old gentleman was\\r\\nvery unhappy about it  but he looked at the strange cat on his hearth\\r\\nand said  “it would be unkind now to send this poor thing away  so it\\r\\nmay as well stay here ”when she heard him speaking of its being unkind  his old cook burst out\\r\\nlaughing  “perhaps ” she said  “’twas a fairy cat  as it could get away\\r\\nthrough bolts and locks  and nothing but a fairy could have taught my\\r\\nmaster to think of a thing being unkind or not  i only hope that now\\r\\nhe’ll think of some one in this world besides himself and his money ”\\r\\nand sure enough from that time the old gentleman began to forget about\\r\\nhis money  and to care for the people about him  and it was all the\\r\\ndoing of the strange cat who had come from no one knew where  and gone\\r\\naway to no one knew where  pg 147 \\nonce upon a time there was a village on the top of a mountain  where\\r\\nduring the winter months the villagers saw no one but each other  for\\r\\nthe mountain was so steep and the path so narrow that  when it was\\r\\nblocked with ice  it was dangerous to ascend  so during the winter\\r\\nmonths the people lived by themselves  and cheered themselves as\\r\\nthey might in the long dreary evenings  with games and dancing and\\r\\nsinging and playing on pipes  for they were cheerful folk  joyous and\\r\\nlight hearted  the sweetest singer in the village was a lad named\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 148 \\r\\n\\r\\nothmar  his voice was as sweet as a nightingale’s before the dawn \\r\\nand also he was the handsomest young fellow in all the country round \\r\\nstrangers turned to look after him as he went by  he was tall and\\r\\nstraight  and had curly brown hair  and big brown eyes  and lips that\\r\\nalways smiled  he lived with his old mother  who was a widow  and he\\r\\nworked for them both in the fields and on the farms  when he was a\\r\\nboy he learned the notes of all the birds  and could imitate them so\\r\\nexactly that they would fly down to him and settle on his shoulders \\r\\nwhen the farmers had sown their fields  and the birds would have come\\r\\nto pick up the grain  they sent for othmar  and he sang and whistled\\r\\ntill they all left the field and flew after him  so often he was called\\r\\nthe bird boy one evening before the winter had set in  or the roads were blocked\\r\\nwith ice  there came along the high road into the village  a dwarf in\\r\\na yellow cap leading a donkey  on whose back were fastened numberless\\r\\nmusical instruments  fiddles of all sorts  and viols  horns  trumpets \\r\\nand pipes  and a big drum  and a small one with triangles and cymbals \\r\\n\\r\\n pg 149 \\r\\n\\r\\nin the middle of the village the little man stopped and looked about\\r\\nhim  “who would like to hear my music ” he cried  and then as the\\r\\nvillagers came crowding around him  he bade them all sit down while he\\r\\nunpacked his mule  but he forbade any of them to help him  or to touch\\r\\none of the instruments  “for mine is no common music ” he quoth  “all\\r\\nthese i have made myself  and in each is a machine which makes it go on\\r\\nplaying by itself  if once i start it  see here ” and he took up a long\\r\\npipe and began to blow  and there came forth the sweetest notes that\\r\\nhad ever been heard from any pipe  the little man paused for a minute \\r\\nwith the pipe in his hand  and then laid it down on the ground  when \\r\\nwonderful to relate  it went on playing of itself all the villagers stared with surprise  and some called out that it\\r\\nwas magic  and crossed themselves  but the little man took up another\\r\\npipe  and set that going too  and then the horns and the trumpets  and\\r\\nthe drums and the cymbals  and then he took a fiddle and drew the bow\\r\\nacross it  and how it played  it made the people weep and laugh  othmar\\r\\nlay on the ground listening  and it seemed to him as if the sound were\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 150 \\r\\n\\r\\nmade of silver  and when the musician had started them  and all the\\r\\nother fiddles were playing together  he felt as if he should go mad for\\r\\njoy to hear anything so lovely just behind where othmar lay sat a young girl  named hulda  she was\\r\\nan orphan  and dwelt alone with an old woman  who gave her food and\\r\\nlodging for sweeping out her room  and cleaning and cooking  also hulda\\r\\nmade money for her by going out to work for the other women in the\\r\\nvillage  she was neither pretty nor clever  but she was a good girl \\r\\nand if any of the villagers were ill or in trouble  it was for hulda\\r\\nthey would send at once  because they knew she would spare no pains to\\r\\nhelp them  and would think nothing too much trouble  she had played\\r\\nwith othmar ever since they were babies  and loved him dearly  she was\\r\\nthe only one who listened to the music who did not think it beautiful \\r\\nshe shuddered as she heard it  and she sat and watched othmar and saw\\r\\nthat there were tears in his eyes  and she grieved that she did not\\r\\nlove it as he did when at last the instruments stopped and the listeners began to feel\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 151 \\r\\n\\r\\nfor money for the musician  he laughed and said  “you need not give me\\r\\nmoney  for i am very rich  and don’t need it  in return for my playing \\r\\ni only ask for one recompense  let any of your young folks who sing \\r\\nsing me a song  for i too love hearing music that is not my own ” on\\r\\nthis the villagers began to look round for all who could sing  and they\\r\\nchose out some three or four  and begged them to sing their very best\\r\\nto the wonderful musician  among them was othmar  but they all bid him\\r\\nwait to the last  as his would be the best  whilst the others were\\r\\nsinging  the little man did not seem to heed them much  though they\\r\\ntried hard to sing well  and chose their prettiest songs  but their\\r\\nvoices sounded very rough and poor after the playing but when othmar began he stopped twanging the fiddle strings and\\r\\nwatched him  othmar’s voice rang out clear and sweet  and all the\\r\\nvillage folk felt proud of his singing  even after hearing the\\r\\nwonderful instruments  when he ceased the little man rose  and said—“you have a sweet voice  my boy  be sure that you always use it well \\r\\nand now i must be going my way  but as i am a stranger here  perhaps\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 152 \\r\\n\\r\\nyou would not mind setting me on my road  and showing me the best way\\r\\nover the hill ”othmar sprang up  delighted to go with him  but hulda  who watched from\\r\\nbehind  came up to him and whispered—“oh  othmar  don’t let him take you far—come back soon ”“how silly you are  hulda ” said othmar  almost angrily  “of course i\\r\\nshall come back  but i shall go with him as far as he wants  and then \\r\\nperhaps  he will let me hear him play again ”othmar and the little dwarf started with the mule laden with\\r\\ninstruments  and othmar led the way down the best road  the dwarf did\\r\\nnot speak at all  and so they went on in silence till they had got on\\r\\nto the top of a high hill where they could see the country all round\\r\\nfor miles  and the moon was beginning to rise  here the musician\\r\\nstopped his mule  and stood for a while looking all round  then he\\r\\nturned  and said to othmar—“i know now where i am  and here will i\\r\\nstay for to night  but first before you leave me  would you not like to\\r\\nhear my fiddles and horns again ” pg 153 “that i would ” cried othmar  and he sat himself down on the ground\\r\\ndelighted  while the little man unloaded the mule “and now ” he said to othmar with a twisted smile  “you shall hear them\\r\\nplay as no one has ever heard them  yes  and you shall see them too ”\\r\\nthen he laid them in rows—the fiddles first  and the viols  and then\\r\\nthe horns and trumpets  and last the drums and cymbals and triangles \\r\\nand clapped his hands  giving a long  shrill whistle  as he whistled \\r\\nthe instruments rose from the ground  and they began to swell  and\\r\\ntheir shapes to change till no longer did they look like musical\\r\\ninstruments  but like human beings  only each had in a strange way kept\\r\\nthe shape it had formerly  the flutes and pipes were tall and thin \\r\\nand they and the violins had changed into beautiful girls with slender\\r\\nthroats  and the trumpets were all men and boys of different sizes  but\\r\\nthe drum was the strangest of all  for it was a fat man with very short\\r\\nlegs  the moon had risen and othmar could see them all quite clearly \\r\\nand though he trembled with fear and his heart beat high  yet still\\r\\nhe watched  they stood silent together for a space in a weird crowd \\r\\n\\r\\n pg 154 \\r\\n\\r\\nand then the dwarf waved his arms and called  “ay  are you all there \\r\\nmy children —yes  one  two three four five  six seven eight  nine\\r\\nten eleven twelve  thirteen—that is right  come practice  practice \\r\\npractice  and then you shall have a game  and see who othmar loves\\r\\nbest  and who he will kiss first ”then they all began to sing together  but each voice was like the sound\\r\\nof its own instrument  only it said words through its tones  and in\\r\\nothmar’s ears their music sounded as never music had sounded before \\r\\nthe voices of the violin girls were so sweet that he felt as if he must\\r\\nweep to hear them  while the sound of the pipes and trumpets filled him\\r\\nwith longing to go into the world and fight and win battles  he sat on\\r\\nthe ground and listened to them like one in a trance  and he felt as if\\r\\nhe never wished to rise or go away again  the dwarf sat on a hillock\\r\\nnear  and did not seem to heed them much  when othmar took his eyes\\r\\nfrom the dancers for a minute  he found that the place was quite full\\r\\nof all the animals who are never seen by day  but who fly out by night \\r\\nthere were crowds of bats and owls  and odd moths  all poised in the\\r\\nair  and seeming to watch the musicians and listen to their singing \\r\\n\\r\\n pg 155 \\r\\n\\r\\nthen when he looked on the ground  he saw that strange wood snakes and\\r\\ntoads had come out boldly  and with their heads turned towards the\\r\\ndancers remained motionless and watched them  whilst near him green and\\r\\nbrown lizards lay still as stone  with heads on one side  all staring\\r\\nthrough the dusky night at the singers  othmar thought he only had\\r\\nwatched them for a few minutes  when suddenly the dwarf cried out—“the\\r\\ndawn  the dawn  my children  see  there is red in the sky  come  be\\r\\nquick  see who will win othmar’s gift before we go on our way ” when\\r\\nhe was silent all the singing girls approached othmar  but before the\\r\\nothers came one who looked slighter and younger  and whose voice though\\r\\nas sweet was weaker “see  othmar ” she cried  “before we go on and leave you  let us try to\\r\\nsing one song together  sing you as i do ” and othmar sang with her as\\r\\nshe sang  in a clear voice like a bird’s— pg 156 and then ere the last notes had left othmar’s mouth  she bent forward \\r\\nand clasped him in her slender arms  and kissed him on the lips while\\r\\nstill they were open to sing “good bye  othmar ” cried she  “and that will be your last note for\\r\\nmany a long year  for surely you will have no need to sing after i am\\r\\ngone ” and at that all the strange folk standing near gave a laugh\\r\\nthat was more a chord of music than a laugh  and when her lips touched\\r\\nothmar’s he quivered all over as a fiddle string does when the bow is\\r\\ndrawn across it  and he gave a cry which was like the sweet sound of a\\r\\nbell “mine  mine ” cried the girl  as he fell back from her frightened  “now\\r\\nmy voice will be the sweetest and best of all  for i have got othmar’s\\r\\ntoo  no one will hear othmar now —othmar who sang like the birds  and\\r\\nnever will he call the birds again  but i can sing as he sang  and all\\r\\nwho hear me will think that othmar sings too  rejoice  my sisters  sing\\r\\nand rejoice ” but at that moment the dwarf started up crying out— pg 157 8  pg 159 “the dawn  the dawn  my children  see  the sun  the sun  beware  beware\\r\\nits rays ” then came a great burst of sound like a chord from all the\\r\\nmusic folk  followed by a flash of light like lightning  and when it\\r\\nhad cleared away  the singing men and girls had gone  and in their\\r\\nplaces there lay upon the ground all the musical instruments—fiddles \\r\\nviols  pipes  horns  and cymbals  othmar stood staring as if he had\\r\\nbeen turned to stone  and watched as if he were in a dream  while the\\r\\nlittle man quietly packed the instruments on to the mule  and went away\\r\\nleading it by the bridle as he had come “good bye  othmar ” he called back  “good bye  when you hear my fiddles\\r\\nagain  they will be sweeter than ever  for i have added your voice to\\r\\nthem ” and he went on his way over the hillside and disappeared beyond\\r\\nthe ridge  othmar ran after him  but he stumbled and fell  he tried to\\r\\ncall out  but no voice would come  tears ran down his cheeks  and he\\r\\nsobbed bitterly  but no sound came with the sobs  and he knew that his\\r\\nvoice had left him  the singing girl had stolen it  and he could never\\r\\nsing or cry out again the sun was rising high in the heavens  the green lizards  slow worms \\r\\nfrogs and beetles were still ranged around  and gazed at othmar with\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 160 \\r\\n\\r\\ntheir heads wonderingly on one side  the birds sang louder and louder \\r\\nand their voices sounded sweet in the morning air  othmar bent his head\\r\\nand wept because he knew that never could he call them to him again \\r\\nthen from behind a bush there rose a big black raven  who cast a long\\r\\nshadow behind him which almost covered othmar as he sat  and it gave a\\r\\ndeep croak and then spoke quite clearly—“poor othmar ” it said  “she has stolen your voice ” and he hopped\\r\\ndown  “you will never speak nor sing again  poor othmar —ah  they\\r\\nstole my voice too  once i could sing far better than the birds you\\r\\nhear now  that was thousands of years ago  but the dwarf came to my\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 161 \\r\\n\\r\\nnest  and told me if i would go with him he would teach me how to\\r\\nwhistle so that the worms should rise out of the ground and jump into\\r\\nmy mouth when they heard me  and he called one of his trumpet men\\r\\nto teach me—one you saw dance—and he bid me lay my beak below his\\r\\nlips while he sang  then he stole my voice  all but a croak  which he\\r\\ndid not want because it was so harsh  but all your voice was sweet \\r\\ntherefore she has got it all—poor othmar  poor othmar ”then othmar raised himself  with the tears running from his eyes  and\\r\\nturned to find his way back to the village  it seemed a long distance \\r\\nfor he missed his path  and it was near nightfall before he saw the\\r\\ntops of the cottages and his own little home  but as he neared the\\r\\nvillage  he could see hulda standing in the road  shading her eyes from\\r\\nthe sun  and watching the way he came “othmar ” she cried when she saw him  “is it you  i have been to search\\r\\nfor you far and near  and there are others now looking for you  for we\\r\\nwere afraid lest you had fallen down some crevice  or slipped over the\\r\\nrocks ”othmar came up to her  and put out his hand  and she saw how pale he\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 162 \\r\\n\\r\\nwas  and that his eyes were full of tears  but he said nothing “othmar  tell me ” cried hulda  “what has happened  why don’t you\\r\\nspeak ” but still othmar was silent  “are you hurt  othmar  did the\\r\\ndwarf do you any harm ”then othmar flung himself on the ground  and began to sob  but his sobs\\r\\ngave no sound  though the ground was wet with his tears  and hulda knew\\r\\nthat othmar was dumb “poor othmar  poor othmar ” croaked the raven who had kept close to\\r\\nothmar  and flew overhead  but hulda did not understand it  only she\\r\\nwept to see his grief “never fear  othmar ” she said tenderly  “your voice will soon come\\r\\nback  it was the long cold night  and the fear that has driven it away \\r\\ncome home with me  and let me nurse you  and you shall soon be well ”othmar shook his head  and the tears fell from his eyes  but he let her\\r\\ntake his hand and lead him into the village where his old mother sat\\r\\nand waited for him  but still  although she sprang forward to greet\\r\\nhim  and put her arms around his neck  he could not speak  and his deep\\r\\nsobs gave no sound  at first the villagers said he was ill  and soon\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 163 \\r\\n\\r\\nhe would be well again  but as the days passed and he never spoke  they\\r\\nknew that he was struck dumb  some said it was the cold  and some that\\r\\nhe had been frightened  only hulda said to herself  “it was the wicked\\r\\nlittle man ”so the days passed  and othmar remained silent and worked with the\\r\\nother young men of the village without speaking  and no longer could\\r\\nhe sing or call the birds to him  always he looked white and sad \\r\\nbut saddest of all when there was any village merry making  and the\\r\\nvillagers sang and danced together  then when he heard them he would\\r\\nput his fingers in his ears and hide his eyes so as not to see them and\\r\\nrun afar off by himself  for the sound of any music was quite horrible\\r\\nto him after the singing of the travelling musicians  so a year passed \\r\\nand othmar never spoke  and instead of calling him the bird boy  the\\r\\nvillage people called him “dumb othmar ”it was midsummer night  and the villagers had been having a\\r\\nmerry making and dancing cheerily on the green in the village  othmar\\r\\nwas not with them  he had left the village and went and sat apart on\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 164 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe top of a rocky hill  from where afar the sea could be seen when the\\r\\nweather was clear  the moon was wonderfully bright  and the country\\r\\nwas almost as light as by day  othmar could hear the sound of their\\r\\nlaughter  but he never laughed  and as he sat with his head bowed upon\\r\\nhis knees he wept silently  so he remained alone till far into the\\r\\nnight when all the singing and dancing was done  and the villagers had\\r\\ngone home  but just when the clocks struck twelve he saw hulda  who\\r\\ncame slowly to him  and he saw that she too was crying “othmar ” she said  “i have thought and thought  and i know that the\\r\\nlittle man with the fiddles was a wicked fairy ” othmar nodded  “so i\\r\\nam going into the big world to find him  for if he has done you this\\r\\nill he will know how to cure you  and i have saved all my money for a\\r\\nyear ”then othmar took her hand  and kissed it  but still wept  as he shook\\r\\nhis head and made signs to her that she must not go  as it would be all\\r\\nin vain  but hulda did not heed him  pg 165 “and now ” she said  “i am going  othmar  and it may be long years\\r\\nbefore i return  so you must do three things  first  you must give me\\r\\na long curl of your brown hair  that i may lay it next my heart and\\r\\nwear it day and night  not to forget you  then you must kiss me on my\\r\\nlips to say good bye  and then you must promise that my name shall be\\r\\nthe first words your lips say when they again can speak ” then othmar\\r\\ntook his knife and cut from his head the longest  brightest curl of his\\r\\nhair  and drew her to him and kissed her thrice upon the lips  and then\\r\\nhe took her hand and with it wrote upon his lips her name  “hulda ” as\\r\\na promise that her name should be the first thing they said “good bye  othmar ” she said  “you will wait for me ” then she turned\\r\\naway and started alone to go down the mountain side  and she looked\\r\\nback as she went and called back  “good bye  othmar ” as long as he\\r\\ncould see or hear her she went straight down the hill and journeyed for a long way  till the\\r\\ndawn began to show red in the sky  and she lay under a tree and slept\\r\\nsoundly till the sun had risen and woke her she sat and thought which way she should go  “i must seek out some\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 166 \\r\\n\\r\\nwise man who knows about fairies and wicked witches ” she said to\\r\\nherself  “and who will tell me where to search  and i will ask every\\r\\none i meet where the wisest person is to be found ” so she went on for\\r\\nmany days till she came to a tiny village  outside which  in a field \\r\\nshe saw a shepherd minding sheep  hulda stopped and asked if he could\\r\\ntell her where she could find a very wise man who could answer her\\r\\nquestion the shepherd thought a bit  and then he said  “the wisest man in these\\r\\nparts lives up in the little cottage on the other side of the village \\r\\nhe cured my sheep two years back when all the flock were sick and many\\r\\ndied—a little cottage with a red gate ” hulda thanked the shepherd \\r\\nand went on till she came to the little cottage with the red gate  when\\r\\nshe had knocked at the door a tall man came out  and she asked him if\\r\\n’twas he who had cured the shepherd’s sheep  and as he was so clever \\r\\nif he would tell her what to do  she told him she wanted to find a\\r\\ndwarf who led a donkey covered with musical instruments  and whom she\\r\\nknew to be a wicked sorcerer  since he struck folk dumb  pg 167 the tall man looked at her and said  “my business is to cure sheep \\r\\ncows  and horses  and i know it right well  but i know nothing of\\r\\ndwarfs and witches  and how can i tell you which way he has gone  or\\r\\nanything about him ”“then of whom had i best ask ” said hulda  “tell me who is the wisest\\r\\nand most learned man in these parts  and i will go to him ”the tall man rubbed his head and considered  “i suppose ” quoth he \\r\\n“that the old school master at the village school yonder would be said\\r\\nto be the most learned man hereabouts  for he teaches the children\\r\\nall sorts of things that they forget when they grow up  that is the\\r\\nschool house on the hill ” so on went hulda again to the school as she came near she could hear the children calling out their lessons \\r\\nand their master  who was an old priest  teaching them  so she waited\\r\\nabout till school hours were over  and the children had all come out \\r\\nand then she timidly went in and curtseyed to the old school master \\r\\nand told him her tale  and asked him  as he was so very learned  if he\\r\\nwould advise her what to do  but instead of answering her the old man\\r\\nat first stared at her in bewilderment  and then he said  “i can teach\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 168 \\r\\n\\r\\nyou to read and write and many wonderful things  but of dwarfs who can\\r\\nsteal a boy’s voice i know nothing  you would do best not to think more\\r\\nof it ”“but some one there must be ” cried hulda  beginning to cry  “who can\\r\\ntell me what to do  and which way to go  for i am sure that the old man\\r\\nwas a fairy  and if so  no living man can help othmar  but only he who\\r\\ndid the mischief can undo it ”the old priest looked at her sadly and shook his head  “my child ”\\r\\nhe said  “this is a foolish talk about fairies and sorcerers  i know\\r\\nnothing of such things  it is only untaught folk and fools who give\\r\\nheed to such matters ”“to untaught folk and fools then i must go  for surely they can help\\r\\nme more than the wise ” she cried  so she left the school house  and\\r\\nstarted again through the little village street  the first person\\r\\nshe met was a baker going home after taking round his bread  and she\\r\\nstopped him and asked him who was the most ignorant and foolish person\\r\\nin those parts the baker stood and stared at her  and seemed to be half angry  at\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 169 \\r\\n\\r\\nlast he said  “i am sure i don’t know anything about fools  you had\\r\\nbetter go on to the cake maker  who lives a mile up the hill  he is \\r\\nto my mind  the biggest fool in these parts ” and tossing his basket\\r\\nabout and seeming to be much offended  he went his way  hulda went on\\r\\nfor a mile up the hill  and there she found a little group of cottages \\r\\nand in their midst was a shop with an open oven  and she could see its\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 170 \\r\\n\\r\\nowner busy making cakes and sweets  hulda went in and bought a cake \\r\\nand as she sat and ate it  she asked the man timidly if he knew many\\r\\nof the people in that neighbourhood  and if any were very ignorant and\\r\\nfoolish “indeed ” cried the man  “you may well ask that  why  a more silly \\r\\nignorant set of folk i never knew  quite different from the people in\\r\\nmy native town  but that is miles away ”“and who do you think the silliest then ” asked hulda “why  for sure ’tis hard to say ” said the man  scratching his head \\r\\n“they’re such a poor silly lot  right away from the mayor down to tommy\\r\\nthe fool ”“and who is tommy the fool ” asked hulda eagerly “’tis a poor natural born idiot who lives with his mother in the little\\r\\ncabin on the side of the common  he spends all his time trying to catch\\r\\na bird  and he never has caught one  and never will ”“thank you for telling me about him ” said hulda  rising to go away \\r\\n“maybe if he is really a fool he could answer my questions as they\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 171 \\r\\n\\r\\nsay ” and she went on again with a lighter heart  at last she came to\\r\\nthe common on which the fool lived with his mother  when she approached\\r\\nthe little cabin  she saw some one dancing about in front of an oak \\r\\ndressed up with the feathers of birds and fowls  which looked as if\\r\\nthey had been picked up from the ground  he was a young man of about\\r\\neighteen  and he had a cheerful face  but any one looking at him could\\r\\nsee at once he was an idiot  he was dancing round the tree and pointing\\r\\nup to the birds  and calling them to come down to him  hulda came up\\r\\nand stood quite close and watched him  as he ran round smiling and\\r\\ngiggling  then she said  “please can you tell me where i shall find a\\r\\nlittle man  a dwarf who drives a donkey covered with pipes and fiddles ”the fool looked at her very gravely  but he said nothing  so then she\\r\\nwent on to tell him how the little man had come to their village  and\\r\\nhow he had stolen othmar’s voice  and how she had come out to seek it \\r\\njust as she finished speaking  there rose from the ground a raven \\r\\n\\r\\n pg 172 \\r\\n\\r\\nand soared above their heads  when he saw it the fool pointed to it \\r\\nand cried out  “the raven  the raven  follow the raven ” and as the\\r\\nraven flew  he ran after him with hulda following in turn  they ran\\r\\nfor a long way  the fool leaping and bounding  and pointing with his\\r\\nfinger and crying  “the raven  the raven  do what the raven does ” then\\r\\nsuddenly he turned  giving a wild laugh  and began to run home again \\r\\nbut as he went he nodded and called to hulda  “follow the raven  follow\\r\\nit  do what the raven does ”hulda felt inclined to burst into tears with disappointment  but still\\r\\nshe ran meekly after the bird  murmuring to herself  “he said follow\\r\\nthe raven  but what good can that do me ” but when the fool had turned\\r\\nback  the raven slackened his pace  and cawed and lighted on a tree \\r\\nand hulda  panting for breath  sat down under it  and looked up at it “poor hulda ” it croaked  but she couldn’t understand it  “poor hulda \\r\\ncome with me  and i will show you where the dwarf is ” then it began to\\r\\nfly slowly on again “what shall i do ” sobbed hulda  “he was only an idiot  he knew\\r\\nnothing  still he told me to follow the raven  and no one else has\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 173 \\r\\n\\r\\ntold me anything ” so on she went  and this time the raven flew quite\\r\\nslowly  so that hulda kept up with it walking  on they travelled till\\r\\nevening was well advanced  into all sorts of places where hulda had\\r\\nnever been  and through many villages  then it began to grow dark  and\\r\\nthe moon came out  but still they travelled on  hulda was foot sore and\\r\\nweary  but she would not give up  and said to herself  “it was what the\\r\\nfool said  ‘follow the raven  do what the raven does ’”just before dawn  they came out on to a big plain  where there were\\r\\nneither houses nor trees  but in the far distance you could see a long\\r\\nline of mountains  a little further in the centre of the plain hulda\\r\\nsaw a little dark mass  and straight to this the raven flew  and as\\r\\nhulda approached it  she saw that it was the little dwarf  lying asleep\\r\\nupon the ground beside his heap of musical instruments  with the mule\\r\\ngrazing near  “oh  good wise fool ” cried hulda  “now indeed you have\\r\\ngiven me the best advice  since the raven has led me to the wicked\\r\\ndwarf  now indeed will i do what the raven does  whatever it be ”the raven flew on  and lit upon a scrubby bush  a little way from\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 174 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe sleeping dwarf  and hulda followed and crouched beside it  making\\r\\nno noise lest she should disturb the sleeper  and hiding behind the\\r\\nbranches so that she could not be seen  presently the little man\\r\\nrose from the ground  and called out  “come  my children  practice \\r\\npractice  the dawn is here  and the sun will rise  and then we must go\\r\\nupon our way ”then hulda saw what othmar had seen before  the pipes raised themselves\\r\\nfrom the ground  and untwisted  and became tall  lithe men  some\\r\\ngradually uncurled themselves  and put forth long arms and became\\r\\nbeautiful girls  till each instrument had taken the likeness of a human\\r\\nbeing  then they began to dance and to sing  and hulda watched them\\r\\nas othmar had watched them  and she too felt as if she had never seen\\r\\nand heard anything so beautiful in her life  and she longed to rush to\\r\\nthem  but she heard the raven croak above her  and remembered the words\\r\\nof the fool  “the raven  the raven  do what the raven does ” then she\\r\\nsaw that the raven had hopped off the tree  and was standing upon the\\r\\nearth in front of her  and was beginning to dig in the earth with its\\r\\nlong beak  as if it would find a worm  “the fool said  do what the\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 175 \\r\\n\\r\\nraven does  so must i dig too ” thought she  and she began to scoop the\\r\\nbrown earth with her hand  till she had made a hole  watching the raven\\r\\nall the time presently she saw that the raven had found a long worm  and held it by\\r\\nits throat in the air  but it did not swallow it  hulda looked into her\\r\\nhole to see if there was a worm there also  and at the bottom she saw\\r\\nlying a long  lithe  green snake  twisted up and apparently torpid \\r\\n“surely ” thought hulda  “if i do what the raven does  i shall take\\r\\nthis out ” and she put her hand into the hole  and grasped the snake\\r\\nby its throat  though she was very much afraid of it  and then she\\r\\ncrouched down behind the raven and the bush “come ” cried the dwarf  when they had all sung together  “now let us\\r\\nhear the last new voice  othmar’s voice was as sweet as silver  now\\r\\nlet me hear how my youngest daughter has treated it ” then there came\\r\\nto the front the youngest and fairest of the girls  and began to sing \\r\\nand when she heard it  hulda could scarcely keep from screaming  for\\r\\nshe recognized that the tones were othmar’s  but just as the singing\\r\\nsounded the sweetest  the raven with a croak opened his mouth  and\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 176 \\r\\n\\r\\ndropped the worm upon the ground  and hulda let go her hold of the\\r\\nbright green snake  which darted through the short grass towards the\\r\\ndancers there arose from all sides the cry of “a snake  a snake ” and they\\r\\nseemed panic stricken  the snake glided straight towards the singing\\r\\ngirl  and deftly coiled itself round her ankles  while from the old\\r\\nman and all the others came a terrible uproar  but the snake from the\\r\\ngirl’s ankles had slid up her body in bright green coils  and then\\r\\ntwisted itself around her throat  and coiled tighter and tighter and\\r\\ntighter  till her head fell over on one side  then hulda heard a noise\\r\\nlike the sighing of wind  but sweet and tender  while the dwarf and all\\r\\nthe singers were in a hubbub and confusion for a moment the old man stood motionless  then he rose and gave a\\r\\nterrible cry  hulda trembled when she heard his voice  it sounded like\\r\\nnothing earthly  but ere he was silent there had risen from the ground\\r\\nand from the bushes near a number of little cloudy forms  black and\\r\\nthick  and twirling in all directions  and they twisted in and out\\r\\namong the singers  and as they twisted among them  they ceased to be\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 177 \\r\\n\\r\\nmen and women  but became musical instruments  as they had been before \\r\\nall save the girl around whose neck the snake had wound  and who seemed\\r\\nto shrivel and shrivel in its coils till she was no more to be seen in less than a minute they were all packed again upon the mule  and the\\r\\nlittle old man was leading it quietly away  as if nothing had happened \\r\\nand upon the grass lay the glittering snake  though all trace of the\\r\\ngirl around whose neck it had twisted had gone  hulda ran to it  and\\r\\nthen she almost cried  for she feared that after all the girl with\\r\\nothmar’s voice had escaped her  but she remembered the words of tommy\\r\\nthe fool  “do as the raven does  follow the raven ” and looking up\\r\\nshe saw that the raven was fluttering above her  with the worm it had\\r\\npicked up from the ground in its mouth “oh  dear raven ” cried hulda  “you brought me to where the little man\\r\\nwas  now lead me back and show me what to do next ” and mindful of the\\r\\nfool’s advice  she picked up the snake  and holding it firmly by the\\r\\nthroat  turned to follow the raven  who flew ahead of her  thus they\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 178 \\r\\n\\r\\njourneyed back  over the same country through which hulda had come\\r\\nbefore  all looked just the same  but hulda was sorely tired  for she\\r\\nhad now been walking many days  and she felt sad  for she did not know\\r\\nif after all she had gained anything  or whether she ought not to have\\r\\nfollowed the little old man  and though she had heard othmar’s voice \\r\\nshe did not know how she was to get it back to him  “never mind ” she\\r\\nsaid to herself  “the fool told me right so far  and evidently he knew\\r\\nall about it  so i had best keep to his advice ”the sun rose high in the sky and the day was very hot  and poor hulda\\r\\nlonged to lie down under the trees and sleep  moreover the snake in her\\r\\nhand twisted and twisted  till she could scarce hold it  sometimes she\\r\\ncried from very weariness  but still the raven flew in front of her \\r\\nshe had bought dry bread as she came along  and when the raven stopped\\r\\nand hopped upon the ground  she munched it to stave off her hunger \\r\\nbut directly the raven began to fly she followed it  and she never let\\r\\nthe snake from her grasp  the sun had set  and dark was all over the\\r\\nland ere she came to the village where the fool lived  but no fool was\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 179 \\r\\n\\r\\nthere to be seen  hulda sought everywhere  but she could not find him \\r\\nthen she saw that the raven had stopped and settled on the roof of the\\r\\ncottage where the fool lived  and  standing on one leg  had gone to\\r\\nsleep with its head under its wing  so hulda lay down by the side of\\r\\nthe door  and laying her head on a stone rested too  but first she took\\r\\noff her girdle and tied it firmly round the snake’s throat  and then\\r\\ntied it round her waist again lest she should fall asleep and the snake\\r\\nglide away just when the stars were beginning to look pale  and as there were\\r\\nsigns of the dawn in the sky  the door of the cottage opened  and out\\r\\nthere came the fool  dressed up as hulda had seen him before  with\\r\\nfeathers and weeds and bits of bright rag  hulda started up  and he\\r\\nlaughed when he saw her  “look ” he said  “the sun is rising  i am come\\r\\nout to see it ”“i have come back ” cried hulda  “and i have seen them all—the old\\r\\nman and the musician girls  and the one who stole othmar’s voice will\\r\\nnever use it again  for this snake has throttled her  but what am i to\\r\\ndo now  how can i give him back his voice  what shall i do to make him\\r\\nspeak ” and as she spoke she took the snake from her bosom and showed\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 180 \\r\\n\\r\\nit to the fool  he looked at it very gravely as he always did when\\r\\nanything was shown to him  and looked very wise and nodded  “it is a\\r\\nsnake ” he said  “perhaps othmar will like the snake ”hulda begged him to tell her if he knew what she should do  but he\\r\\nwould say no more  but began to dance and sing as she had seen him do\\r\\nbefore  then at last hulda burst out crying  “he is nothing but a poor\\r\\nidiot ” she said  “and i have been on a fool’s errand when i did as he\\r\\ntold me  though i did see the wicked little man  and this snake did\\r\\npunish the singing girl  so i will take it back to othmar that he may\\r\\nsee i have tried  but now i believe he will be dumb for ever ”and she took the snake and looked at it as she held it  it was very\\r\\nstill  and seemed half torpid  though the weather was warm  she saw it\\r\\nwas not a common snake  for it was bright brown  and green with odd\\r\\nmarkings  and it glittered oddly when the sun’s rays touched it “i will go back now ” said hulda  “i will go back to othmar  and tell\\r\\nhim i have failed  and ask him to forgive my vanity in thinking\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 181 \\r\\n\\r\\ni could help him  i will go back at once and tell him all ” and\\r\\noverhead the raven croaked and told her to go quickly  but she did not\\r\\nunderstand what he said so again she began to trudge on  holding the snake in her hands and\\r\\ntoiling over fields and moors in the way that she knew led to her own\\r\\nlittle village  though by now her feet were so swollen and her legs so\\r\\nstiff that she almost cried for pain presently she came to the village where the cake maker lived  and as\\r\\nshe passed his shop  she saw that he stood at the door and nodded to\\r\\nher as he saw her coming “good day ” he cried  “you are the young wench i saw go past awhile\\r\\nback ”“yes  i am going home now ” said hulda “and have you found your fiddles and horns that turned to men and\\r\\nwomen ” he asked  “it was a fool’s errand  i fear  you were going on \\r\\nand what have you got in your hand now ”“it is a snake ” answered hulda  “and——”“a snake ” screamed the cake maker  “lord love the girl  is she mad to\\r\\ngo wandering over the country carrying a snake with her  why  it might\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 182 \\r\\n\\r\\nkill you  wench  drop it at once ”“no  indeed  i will not drop it ” said hulda  “for it seems to me that\\r\\nit is the only thing which may do othmar good  for at any rate it has\\r\\nkilled the girl who stole his voice  and——”at this the man started and called out  “good lord  she is clean off\\r\\nher head  stolen othmar’s voice  what can the wench mean  why  girl \\r\\nthat snake might bite you  and you would be dead at once  why on earth\\r\\nshould you carry it because it has killed a girl ”“i am carrying it because the fool told me to do what the raven does ”\\r\\nanswered hulda  “and he has still a worm in his mouth  look ”at this the man burst out laughing  “why  what has that to do with\\r\\nyou ” he cried  “a raven will often carry a worm for a bit  drop this\\r\\nsnake at once  you silly lass  or  better still  hold it firm while i\\r\\ncrush its head with my poker ” and he seized the poker to kill it with then hulda was frightened lest he might steal the snake from her  or\\r\\nkill it by force  and she ran on  but she ran in such haste that she\\r\\nstumbled against the baker who was just coming out from his shop with\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 183 \\r\\n\\r\\nhis basket of loaves on his arm “can’t you look where you are going ” he cried in anger  as he picked\\r\\nup the bread which had rolled into the road  and then  seeing it was\\r\\nhulda  he said —“why  who are you running away from  my girl  are you\\r\\non the look out for more fools that you can’t see when an honest man\\r\\ncomes along  and whatever have you got there ”“it is only a snake i have found ” said hulda  when she had asked the\\r\\nman’s pardon  and she tried to hide the snake in her skirt  but the\\r\\nbaker seized her arm and made her show it to him “what on earth are you carrying a live snake with you for ” he asked \\r\\n“don’t you know they are venomous beasts  and the bite of one is\\r\\ncertain death ” and  like the cake maker  he tried to wrench the snake\\r\\nfrom her  at this hulda was terribly frightened “if they take the snake from me ” she thought  “then my last chance is\\r\\ngone ” and she tried to free herself from the baker  but he seized her\\r\\nby the skirt and held her fast  and shouted out to others to come and\\r\\nhelp him  pg 184 “help  help ” he cried  “here is a poor mad girl  and she has got hold\\r\\nof a poisonous adder  and she will let it loose in the village and it\\r\\nwill bite some of our children and kill them ” and when they heard his\\r\\ncry the villagers all came running out of their cottages “let me go  let me go ” shrieked hulda  “it will do no harm  i will\\r\\nhold it tight  and i would not lose it for the wide world ”“i tell you she is mad ” roared the baker  and the cake maker came up\\r\\nand said the same thing  “she wandered by here some time back  and all\\r\\nshe wanted to know was where she could find another as mad as herself \\r\\nbut she will have far to go before she meets one  i reckon  we must\\r\\nsecure her and take the snake from her  but beware how you catch it \\r\\nfor fear it should bite ”and the people all gathered round her and made a great hubbub  though\\r\\nthey were afraid to touch the snake which hulda still held firmly in\\r\\nher hand  and they made such a din that the old school master came out\\r\\nof the school house with his pupils after him the people told him there was a poor mad girl who had got a snake  and\\r\\nwould not let them take it from her  and he remembered hulda as the\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 185 \\r\\n\\r\\nothers had done  and shook his head and said sadly  “i fear it is too\\r\\ntrue  the poor child is really mad  but we cannot wrench the snake from\\r\\nher lest it may turn and bite us  but it is certain that it would not\\r\\nbe safe to let her go  so  as the children are all going home now  let\\r\\nus lock her into the school house here  till we can get something to\\r\\nkill the creature with  and then when the doctor comes  he can see if\\r\\nthe poor girl is very bad  and what had better be done with her ”hulda turned quite white with fear  and cried out that she was not mad \\r\\nand that the snake should harm no one  but they would not heed her \\r\\nand pushed her into the school house  and bolted the doors on her  and\\r\\nthere hulda sat on the floor and cried as if her heart would break “alas ” cried she  “now all hope is gone  and othmar will be dumb for\\r\\never  for what good have i carried this snake with me all this way  if\\r\\nnow it is to be taken from me and killed ” and her tears fell on the\\r\\nviper as she looked at it in her hand  it was very bright green and\\r\\nyellow  and it kept wrinkling and twisting its skin as she grasped\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 186 \\r\\n\\r\\nit  and making a loud hissing noise  as her tears were still falling\\r\\nshe heard a croak over her head  and saw the raven perched on a window\\r\\nabove her  and again her hopes revived “maybe he has come to help me ” she thought  “for i should never have\\r\\nfound the little dwarf if it had not been for the raven ” then as she\\r\\nlooked up at the raven sitting in the window  she saw that it was\\r\\npecking at a piece of rope that hung through the window  and hulda\\r\\nthought—“surely if i could climb up to the window  i could scramble\\r\\nthrough it  and climb down the rope on to the ground  only if they were\\r\\nto see me  they would catch me again  so i must wait till nightfall\\r\\nwhen there is no one there ”so she sat down again and waited till the sun had set  and she trembled\\r\\nat every noise lest it might be some one coming to seek her  but they\\r\\nleft her alone  and no one came  when it was quite dark  and all the\\r\\nvillage was quiet she went to the window  and tried to climb up to it \\r\\nbut she found that she could not manage to get up on to the window sill\\r\\nwhile she held the snake in her hand  then first she thought she would\\r\\nwind it around her waist  but she remembered how it had tightened\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 187 \\r\\n\\r\\naround the singing girl and killed her  and for some time she could\\r\\nnot think what to do with it  at last she twisted it into a knot  and\\r\\nplaced it in her bosom  though she trembled lest it should bite her \\r\\nand when she placed it in her bosom  she saw the curl of othmar’s hair\\r\\nthat lay there  and she took it and tied up the snake’s jaws with it so\\r\\nthat it might not open its mouth  “for othmar’s hair will not break or\\r\\ngive way ” she said  “it is like his heart  it will be true and strong\\r\\ntill the end ”then she climbed up on to the window ledge  and scrambled through the\\r\\nwindow  and took the piece of rope and let herself down on to the\\r\\nground outside  and when she lit upon the ground  she heard the raven\\r\\ncroaking above her  and her heart leapt for joy  and she began to run\\r\\nas fast as she could to get away from the village lest they might catch\\r\\nher again when she came again into the open country  she looked for the raven \\r\\nand saw that it was flying in front of her as before  towards the\\r\\ndistant mountains where she knew lay her home  she toiled on  for many\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 188 \\r\\n\\r\\ndays  but by now the summer had nearly passed away  and when she got\\r\\ninto the high mountain land  she found that the cold winter had given\\r\\nsigns of coming  and the trees were beginning to be bare  and there was\\r\\na light white frost on the ground  it was far into the night when she\\r\\narrived in the village  and the villagers were all asleep and their\\r\\ncottages shut  outside the cottage where othmar lived grew a big old\\r\\nivy tree  and on this the raven perched  and underneath it hulda lay\\r\\ndown to wait the dawn and othmar’s waking  she lay quiet for a bit \\r\\nbut when she saw a faint glimmering of light where the sun was going\\r\\nto rise  she felt she could be still no longer  and she sprang up and\\r\\ncalled  “othmar  come down  i am here ” for she dreaded having to tell\\r\\nhim before the other villagers that she had failed in a few moments the door of the cottage opened and othmar came out \\r\\nand ran to greet her  but she kept afar “othmar ” she cried  “i have done you no good  save that i have\\r\\npunished the wicked girl who took your voice  this snake killed her  so\\r\\nshe will never sing as you did again  see ” and she held out the snake\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 189 \\r\\n\\r\\nto him  it was curled round and still tied up with his hair  and as the\\r\\nsun began to shine it glittered brightly “but i have done you no good  indeed rather harm ” hulda went on  “for\\r\\ni have made you hope where there was no hope  and you have waited and\\r\\nexpected that i should bring you back what you had lost  and i have not\\r\\ndone it  and now i shall never hear you say my name ‘hulda’ again ” and\\r\\nshe wept so bitterly that the tears fell from her face  and dropped\\r\\nupon the snake which still she grasped  othmar held out his hand  and\\r\\ntried to take her hand that he might kiss it  and as he did so  he\\r\\ntouched the snake’s long tail  and it began to writhe and twist  and\\r\\nglisten more and more as the sun shone on it  and as he raised her hand\\r\\nto his mouth  othmar tried to say her name “hulda” with his poor dumb\\r\\nlips that could make no sound  and he breathed it on the snake  and it\\r\\nseemed as if the snake vibrated with the name  and suddenly it swelled\\r\\nand swelled  and shone still more brightly  and its mouth grew wide and\\r\\nburst othmar’s hair which had bound it  and widened out till it was not\\r\\na snake any more  but a curled golden trumpet  curled up as the snake\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 190 \\r\\n\\r\\nhad been  and like that which had been changed into the singing girl\\r\\nwho stole othmar’s voice  “take it  othmar  and blow ” cried hulda \\r\\nand he put it to his lips and cried “hulda ” and hulda heard her name\\r\\nechoing back in a burst of music from all around  at its sound the\\r\\nbirds awoke in all the trees  and began their morning chorus  and the\\r\\nvillage folk ran to their windows to see what the trumpet’s peal had\\r\\nbeen  and saw othmar standing with hulda in his arms  and at their feet\\r\\nthe bright trumpet which he had dropped  it lay on the ground  but as\\r\\nothmar began to speak and to say  “hulda  hulda  you have brought it\\r\\nback  you have given me my voice again ” the trumpet broke into many\\r\\npieces  and with every word crumbled  till there was nothing left but\\r\\na little heap of shining golden sand  and from under it there glided\\r\\nout a dark green snake with yellow markings  and it slid away into the\\r\\nbushes and disappeared then all the villagers rejoiced  and hulda wept with happiness  and\\r\\nothmar married hulda  and his voice never left him again  but when\\r\\nlong years after folk would tell him his voice was sweet and far more\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 191 \\r\\n\\r\\nbeautiful than the birds  he would say  “but it is not really my voice \\r\\nit is my wife’s  hulda’s  for i should have been dumb for ever if she\\r\\nhad not sought it and brought it back to me ” pg 192 \\nonce upon a time there lived a shepherd and his wife  who lived in\\r\\na very lonely little cottage far from town or village  near some\\r\\nmountains  it was a wild neighbourhood  and the wind blew across the\\r\\nmountains fiercely  and the rain often fell so heavily that it seemed\\r\\nas if the cottage would be washed away  one evening when the shepherd\\r\\nwas out  there came on a great storm of rain which beat against the\\r\\ndoors and the windows violently  as the shepherd’s wife sat listening\\r\\nto it by the fire  it seemed to her as if it sounded louder than she\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 193 \\r\\n\\r\\nhad ever heard it before  and the raindrops sounded like the knock of\\r\\na hand that was knocking to gain admittance  it went on for a little\\r\\ntime  till the shepherd’s wife could bear to listen to it no longer \\r\\nand she rose and went to the door to open it  though she knew that\\r\\nshe would let the wind and rain into the room  as she opened the door\\r\\na gust of rain was blown in her face  and then she saw that in the\\r\\ndoorway stood a woman who had been knocking  she was a tall woman\\r\\nwrapped in a grey cloak with long hair falling down her back  “thank\\r\\nyou ” she said  and though her voice was very low  the shepherd’s wife\\r\\ncould hear it plainly through all the storm  “thank you for opening the\\r\\ndoor to me  many would have let me stand outside  now may i come into\\r\\nyour cottage and rest ”“how wet you must be ” cried the shepherd’s wife  “come in and rest \\r\\nand let me give you food  have you come from far ”“no  i come from quite near ” said the woman  and she came into the\\r\\ncottage as she spoke  and sat down in a chair near the door  “and i\\r\\nwant no food  only a glass of water  i must go on directly  but i have\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 194 \\r\\n\\r\\nnot far to go  and i shall be no wetter than i am now ”the shepherd’s wife stared in surprise  for she saw that apparently\\r\\nthe woman’s clothes were not wet at all  and what was stranger still \\r\\nthough she had thought she was only clad in a dull grey cloak  now she\\r\\nsaw that she was covered with jewellery —clear stones  like diamonds\\r\\nwith many flashing colours  and she also saw that all her clothes were\\r\\nof the finest  she gave her a glass of water  and begged that as well\\r\\nshe might give her other food  but the woman shook her head  and said\\r\\nno  water was all she needed  when she had drunk the water she gave\\r\\nback the glass to the shepherd’s wife  and said  “and so this is your\\r\\nhome  have you all that you want in life  are you happy ”“ay  we are happy enough ” said the shepherd’s wife  “save indeed for\\r\\none thing  ten years ago my little baby girl died  and i have no other\\r\\nchildren  i long for one sorely  that i might take care of it and make\\r\\nit happy  while it is little  and then in turn  when i am old  it would\\r\\nlove and care for me ”“and if you had a little child ” said the woman  rising up and\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 195 \\r\\n\\r\\nstanding before the shepherd’s wife  “you think you would really love\\r\\nit better than anything in the world  many women say that  but few do\\r\\nit  before long a little child will be born to you  and as long as you\\r\\nlove it better than anything in the world it will remain with you  but\\r\\nwhen you love anything else better than your little daughter and her\\r\\nhappiness  it will go from you  so remember my words  good bye ” and\\r\\nthe woman walked to the door and went quietly out into the rain  and\\r\\nthe shepherd’s wife saw her disappearing  and the rain pelting around\\r\\nher  but her clothes were not blown about  neither did the rain seem to\\r\\nwet her a year passed away  and the shepherd’s wife had a tiny daughter  a\\r\\nlovely little baby with the bluest eyes and the softest skin  the\\r\\nevening she was born the wind howled and the rain fell as fiercely as\\r\\non the night when the grey woman had come into the shepherd’s cottage \\r\\nthe shepherd and his wife both loved their little daughter very dearly \\r\\nas well they might  as no fairer child was ever seen  but as she grew\\r\\nolder  some things about her frightened her mother  and she had some\\r\\nways of which she could not cure her  pg 196 she would never go near a fire  however cold she was  neither did\\r\\nshe love the sunshine  but always ran from it and crept into the shade \\r\\nbut when she heard the rain pattering against the window panes she\\r\\nwould cry  “listen  mother  listen to my brothers and sisters dancing ”\\r\\nand then she would begin to dance too in the cottage  her little feet\\r\\npattering upon the boards  or  if she possibly could  she would run\\r\\nout on to the moor and dance  with the rain falling upon her  and her\\r\\nmother had much ado to get her to come back into the cottage  yet she\\r\\nnever seemed to get very wet  nor did she catch cold  pg 197 a river ran near the cottage  and by it she would go\\r\\nand sit for hours dabbling her feet in the water  and singing sweet\\r\\nlittle songs to herself still  in all other ways she was a good \\r\\naffectionate girl  and did all that her mother told her  and seemed\\r\\nto love both her parents tenderly  and the shepherd’s wife would say\\r\\nto herself  “my only trouble is that when she is grown up  she will\\r\\nwant to marry  and leave me  and i shall have to do without her ” time\\r\\npassed  and the old shepherd died  but his wife and daughter still\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 198 \\r\\n\\r\\nlived on in the little cottage  and the daughter grew to be a most\\r\\nbeautiful young maiden  her eyes were clear light blue  like the colour\\r\\nof the far off sea  but it was difficult to say what was the colour of\\r\\nher hair  save that it was very light  and hung in heavy masses over\\r\\nher brow and shoulders  once or twice her mother felt sorely frightened\\r\\nabout her  it was when spring showers were falling  and the young\\r\\ngirl had gone into the little garden in front of the cottage to let\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 199 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe rain fall upon her head and face  as she loved to do  in spite of\\r\\nall her mother could say  then she began to dance  as she always did\\r\\nwhen the rain fell  and as she danced the sun came out while the rain\\r\\nwas yet falling  her mother watched her from the cottage window  but\\r\\nwhile she watched her it seemed to her as if her daughter was covered\\r\\nwith jewels of every colour  clear and bright  they hung around her in\\r\\nchains  and made her look more like a king’s daughter than a shepherd’s\\r\\ngirl  “come in  child  come in ” called the shepherd’s wife  and when\\r\\nthe young girl came in the cottage all traces of the jewels had gone \\r\\nand when her mother upbraided her for going out to dance in the rain \\r\\nshe only answered  “it hurts no one  my mother  and it pleases me  why\\r\\nshould you stop me ”a little way from the cottage on the mountain side stood an old castle \\r\\nwhere formerly the kings of the land used to come and stay  but which\\r\\nnow had not been used for very many years  one day  however  the\\r\\nshepherd’s wife saw great preparations were being made to beautify and\\r\\nadorn it  and she knew that the king and his son were coming to stay\\r\\nthere again  soon after they had arrived  the shepherd’s daughter went\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 200 \\r\\n\\r\\ndown to the river  as was her wont  and sat on the bank  dipping her\\r\\nfeet in the ripples  presently there came up a boat  and it was a grand\\r\\nyoung man dressed all in velvet and gold who leaned over the side to\\r\\nfish “who are you  and what are you doing here ” cried the shepherd’s\\r\\ndaughter  for she was afraid of no one “i am the king’s son ” said he  “and i am coming here to fish  who are\\r\\nyou  and where do you come from  for i have never seen such a beautiful\\r\\nmaiden in my life ” and he looked at her and could scarce speak  so\\r\\nbeautiful did she seem to him “it is cruel to take the fishes out of the water ” cried the shepherd’s\\r\\ndaughter  “leave them alone  and come and dance on the bank with me ”\\r\\nand she went under the shade of a large tree  and began to dance  and\\r\\nthe king’s son watched her  and again he thought so beautiful a maid\\r\\nthere had never been  pg 201 2  pg 203 day after day he came down to the river to fish  and day after day he\\r\\nleft the line and tackle to sit and watch the shepherd’s daughter  and\\r\\neach time found her more enchanting  once he tried to kiss her\\r\\nhand  but she sprang from him and left him sitting in his boat alone \\r\\nat last a day came when the prince said to his father  “my father  you\\r\\nwant me to wed so that i may have an heir to the throne  but there is\\r\\nonly one woman that can ever be my wife  and that is the daughter of\\r\\nthe poor woman who lives in the little cottage out yonder ”at first the old king was very wroth  but he loved his son well  and\\r\\nknew that nothing would shake him from his word  so he told him that if\\r\\nhe would bring home his bride  he too would rejoice and love her as his\\r\\ndaughter even though she be a beggar maid  then the young prince rode\\r\\ndown to the cottage  and went in and told the shepherd’s wife how he\\r\\nhad seen her daughter  and loved her and wished to make her his wife \\r\\nso that she would be queen of the country the shepherd’s wife went nearly wild with joy  “to think that my\\r\\ndaughter should be the queen ” she said to herself  and when her\\r\\ndaughter came into the cottage she did not know how to contain herself \\r\\nbut folded her in her arms and kissed her  crying and declaring that\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 204 \\r\\n\\r\\nnever was woman so blessed “why  what has happened  my mother  and what has pleased you so ” said\\r\\nher daughter  while still the shepherd’s wife rejoiced and wept for joy “it is the king’s son  my girl  the king’s own son  and he has just\\r\\nbeen here  and he loves you because you are so beautiful  and he will\\r\\nmarry you and make you queen of all the land  was there ever such luck\\r\\nfor a poor woman ”but the daughter only said  “but i don’t want to marry the king’s son \\r\\nmother  or any one  i will never be the wife of any man  i will stay\\r\\nwith you and nurse you when you are old and sick  for i can live in no\\r\\nhouse but this cottage  and have no friend but my mother ”on hearing this the shepherd’s wife became very angry  and told her\\r\\ndaughter that she must be mad  and that she must wait for a day or two \\r\\nand she would be only too thankful for the love of the king’s son  and\\r\\nfor the honour he was going to do her in making her his queen  but\\r\\nstill the daughter shook her head  and said quite quietly  “i will\\r\\nnever be the wife of the king’s son ” the shepherd’s wife did not dare\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 205 \\r\\n\\r\\ntell the king’s son what her daughter had said  but told him that he\\r\\nhad better speak to her himself if he wished to make her his wife  then\\r\\nwhen he was again sitting in the boat on the river  and the maiden on\\r\\nthe bank  the king’s son told her how much he loved her  and that he\\r\\nwould share with her all that he had in this world  but the shepherd’s\\r\\ndaughter only shook her head and said  “i will never live at the\\r\\npalace  and i will never be a queen ”the old king had ordered great preparations to be made for the wedding \\r\\nwhich was to take place immediately  and all sorts of fine clothes were\\r\\nordered for the shepherd’s daughter  that she might appear properly as\\r\\nthe wife of the prince  but for the few days just before the wedding \\r\\nthe rain fell as it had never been known to have fallen  it beat\\r\\nthrough the roofs of the cottages  and the river swelled and overflowed\\r\\nits banks  everyone was frightened  save indeed the shepherd’s\\r\\ndaughter  who went out into the wet and danced as was her wont  letting\\r\\nthe torrents fall upon her head and shoulders but the evening before the wedding day she knelt beside her mother’s\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 206 \\r\\n\\r\\nside  “dear mother ” she said  “let me stop with you and nurse you when\\r\\nyou are old  do not send me away to the palace to live with the king’s\\r\\nson ”then the mother was very angry  and told her daughter that she was very\\r\\nungrateful  and she ought to be thankful that such luck had come in her\\r\\nway  and who was she  the daughter of a poor shepherd  that she should\\r\\nobject to marrying the king’s son all night long the rain fell in torrents  and when next day the\\r\\nshepherd’s daughter was dressed in all her finery  it was through pools\\r\\non the ground that she had to step into the grand carriage which the\\r\\nking had sent to fetch her  and while the marriage service was being\\r\\nread  the priest’s voice could scarcely be heard for the pattering of\\r\\nthe drops upon the roof  and when they went into the castle to the\\r\\nbanquet  the water burst through the doors opened to receive them \\r\\nso that the king and the wedding guests had hard ado to keep dry  it\\r\\nwas a grand feast  and the king’s son sat at one end of the table \\r\\nand his young wife was beside him dressed in white and gold  all the\\r\\ncourtiers and all the fine guests declared that surely the world had\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nnever contained such a beautiful young woman as their future queen  but\\r\\njust when the goblets were filled with wine  to drink to the health of\\r\\nthe bride and bridegroom  there came a cry  “the floods  the floods ”\\r\\nand the servants ran into the hall  crying out that the waters were\\r\\npouring in  and in one moment the rooms were filled with water  and no\\r\\none thought of anything but to save themselves  when the hurricane had\\r\\nsubsided  and the waters gone down  they looked around for the prince’s\\r\\nwife  who was nowhere to be found  every one said that she had been\\r\\nswept away by the torrents  and that she had been drowned in all her\\r\\nyouth and beauty  only the shepherd’s wife wept alone  and remembered\\r\\nthe words of the woman who came to her on the night of the storm  “when\\r\\nyou love aught on earth better than your daughter and her happiness \\r\\nshe will go from you ”the king’s son mourned his wife  and for long would not be comforted \\r\\nbut when many years had passed  he married a beautiful princess  and\\r\\nwith her lived very happily  only when the rain fell in torrents and\\r\\nbeat against the window panes it would seem to him as if he heard the\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 208 \\r\\n\\r\\nsound of dancing feet  and a voice that called out  “come and dance\\r\\nwith me  come and dance with me and my brothers and sisters  oh  king’s\\r\\nson  and feel our drops upon your face ” pg 209 \\na young ploughman was following his plough in a field one morning when\\r\\nsuddenly the horses stopped  and do what he would he could not make\\r\\nthem stir  then he tried to push the plough himself  but he could\\r\\nnot move it one hair’s breadth  he stooped down to see what could be\\r\\nstopping it  when a deep voice cried  “stop  i am coming up ” the\\r\\nvoice was so loud that the ploughman shook with fear  but though he\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 210 \\r\\n\\r\\nlooked all around him  he could see no one from whom it could come \\r\\nbut presently it spoke again  only this time it was a little lower  \\r\\nand called out  “have patience  and i shall be up in a moment ” the\\r\\nploughman quaked in every limb  and stood quite still  and the voice\\r\\nbegan again  but this time it was no louder than most folks’   and it\\r\\nsaid—“if you will only not be in such a hurry  i will tell you what i\\r\\nwant  look in front of your horse’s right foot  and pick me up ”he bent down and looked on the ground  and there in the earth  just in\\r\\nfront of his horse’s right foot  he saw what he thought was a little\\r\\nblack lizard  he touched it very cautiously  and started back with\\r\\nsurprise when the voice spoke again  and he found it came from this\\r\\ntiny creature “yes ” it said  “that is quite right  you can pick me up in your hand\\r\\nif you like  but i think i must grow a little bigger  as i am really\\r\\nuncomfortably small ” and while he held it on the palm of his hand \\r\\nthe ploughman saw that it was beginning to grow larger  and it swelled\\r\\nso fast that in a few seconds it was near a foot high  and he had to\\r\\ntake both hands to hold it  then he saw that it was not a lizard  but\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 211 \\r\\n\\r\\na little black woman with a face that looked as though it were made of\\r\\nindia rubber  and ugly little black hands “there  that will do ” said the strange little gnome  “that is a nice\\r\\nuseful size  oh dear  how tiring growing is  i don’t think i’ll be any\\r\\nbigger just yet  now be sure you don’t drop me  and handle me very\\r\\ncarefully  for i do not like to be roughly touched  i have not slept\\r\\nnearly as long as i meant to  i wanted a hundred years’ nap  and it\\r\\ncannot be more than fifty  but now that i am awake i think i will keep\\r\\nso for a bit  you seem to be rather a nice civil young man  how would\\r\\nyou like to take me for a lodger ”“a lodger ” gasped the ploughman  “why  what should i do with you ”“i should give no trouble ” said the gnome  “but are there any women in\\r\\nyour house ”“no ” said the ploughman  “for i have no wife  and i am too poor to\\r\\nkeep a servant ”“so much the better ” said the gnome  “for though i am a woman myself \\r\\ni detest women  and only get on with men ” pg 212 “you a woman ” cried the ploughman  and he laughed outright “of course i am a woman ” said the creature  “come  say quickly  do you\\r\\nlike to have me for a lodger or not  of course you will have to agree\\r\\nto my terms ”“and what are your terms ” asked the ploughman “only this  whatever comes into the house  you must always give the\\r\\nbest of it to me  i will choose where i shall live for myself  when i\\r\\nsee the house  but of all the food you have  you must save the best and\\r\\ngive it to me  not much of it  but the very best pieces  as you are\\r\\na man i cannot wear your clothes  but you can give me some of their\\r\\nmaterial  and of everything else that comes into the house of any sort \\r\\ntobacco  or carpets  or furniture  i must have some of the best  and at\\r\\nmeals i must always be helped first  if you agree to this  i may stay\\r\\nwith you for a very long time ”“oh  oh ” said the ploughman  “and pray what shall i get by it  it\\r\\nseems to me as if you wanted to get the best of everything and give\\r\\nnothing in return ” pg 213 “on the contrary ” replied the gnome  “i shall give a very great deal \\r\\nfor as long as i remain in your house  all things will go well with\\r\\nyou  you are a poor man now  but you will soon be a rich one  if you\\r\\nsow seeds they will give twice as much crop as other people’s  all your\\r\\nanimals will do well  and in a little time  instead of being a poor\\r\\nploughman  you will be the richest farmer in the countryside ”“well ” quoth the ploughman  “i don’t mind trying  i think it would\\r\\nrather amuse me to take you to my cottage  but if you don’t keep your\\r\\npart of the bargain  and i don’t find things are going very well with\\r\\nme  i warn you i’ll pretty soon turn you out ”“agreed ” said the gnome  “but remember  if you fail in your compact\\r\\nwith me  i shall go by myself  now carry me home and let me choose\\r\\nwhere i will live ”the ploughman carried the odd little figure back to his cottage  gaping\\r\\nwith astonishment  there he put it down on the kitchen table in the\\r\\nlittle kitchen  it looked all round it  and twisted about its little\\r\\nblack head “that will do nicely ” it said at last  “there is a little hole in\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 214 \\r\\n\\r\\nthat corner  down which i can go  and near that hole you must place all\\r\\nyour daintiest bits  and remember that i must always be helped first\\r\\nat all your meals ” and without a word it leaped from the table  and\\r\\nscuttled away down a big hole that the rats had made  and was no more\\r\\nto be seen but when in the evening the ploughman came in to eat his meal  before\\r\\nhe began it he took the very best bit of meat and the nicest of the\\r\\nvegetable  and laid them down near the hole  then he watched eagerly\\r\\nto see what would happen  but while he looked there they remained \\r\\nsuddenly  however  the door shut with a bang  and he turned his head\\r\\nfor a moment to see what caused it  and when he looked back the food\\r\\nhad disappeared  every day it was much the same  he put some of the\\r\\nbest food on the table down near the hole  but as long as he watched\\r\\nthere it remained  but when he took his eyes off for a moment it had\\r\\ndisappeared  in the same way when he had new clothes  he took a choice\\r\\nbit of material and laid it near the hole  and it vanished also  and of\\r\\nwhatever came into the house he took some of the best and did the same\\r\\nwith it  pg 215 meantime things began to improve very much with him  he had only a\\r\\nlittle bit of land round his cottage  but this year the vegetables and\\r\\nfruit he had planted there grew so well that he had a large quantity to\\r\\nsend to market  and he sold them for such good prices  that soon he was\\r\\nable to get more land and buy his own animals  and in a little while\\r\\nhad a farm of his own  and had grown to be quite a rich man  while all\\r\\nhis neighbours said his luck was extraordinary  meantime he saw or\\r\\nheard nothing more of the little black gnome  and except when he put\\r\\nthe food and other thing’s near the hole almost forgot all about her time passed  and the time came when the ploughman began to think he\\r\\nwould like to take a wife  he made up his mind to marry a very pretty\\r\\ngirl in the next village  who was said to be the prettiest girl in all\\r\\nthe neighbourhood  many of the young men would have liked to marry\\r\\nher  but the ploughman was a handsome  cheery young fellow  and she\\r\\npreferred him to all of the others  and so they were married  and she\\r\\ncame home to live at the farm  the evening after their wedding they had\\r\\na fine fat fowl for supper  and the ploughman before he helped his\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 216 \\r\\n\\r\\nwife cut off the choicest slice from the breast and took it as usual to\\r\\nthe hole “husband ” cried the wife  “have you gone mad that you should give the\\r\\nbest of the food to the rats and the mice ”“i am not mad at all ” said the ploughman  “but my grandfather loved\\r\\nnothing in the world so well as rats and mice  and he made me promise\\r\\nbefore he died that they should always be well cared for in my house \\r\\nand have of the best ”“then if you are not mad ” replied the wife  “i think your grandfather\\r\\nwas  it is only the best poison that is good for rats and mice \\r\\nand they shall have it soon  now that i am in the house ” but the\\r\\nploughman caressed his wife and begged her to let him keep his promise\\r\\nto his grandfather  and the wife held her peace  not liking to seem\\r\\nbad tempered on her wedding day  after a bit she got used to her\\r\\nhusband putting down little bits of food  as he said  for the rats and\\r\\nmice  and though she always declared she was going to poison them  she\\r\\ndid not try to do so  as her husband seemed grieved when she talked\\r\\nabout it  pg 217 thus things went on very happily for some months  when the wife began\\r\\nto think that her clothes were getting very old  and that she must\\r\\nhave some new ones  so she took plenty of money and went into the\\r\\nneighbouring town  and came home with new dresses  and hats  and\\r\\nbonnets  and very pretty she looked in them  and her husband was very\\r\\nmuch pleased with them  but that evening after his wife was gone\\r\\nto bed  as the ploughman was finishing his pipe in the kitchen  he\\r\\nsuddenly heard a deep voice from the hole  which called out just as it\\r\\nhad done months before  “stop  i am coming up ”for an instant the ploughman quaked with fear  then he saw something no\\r\\nbigger than a black beetle creeping through the hole  and it came in\\r\\nfront of his chair  and he heard the voice  which was not so loud this\\r\\ntime  say—“that will do  now i am going to begin to grow a little ” and it began\\r\\nto grow  and grow  and grow  till it was about eight inches high  and\\r\\nthe ploughman saw it was the little black woman  “there ” she said \\r\\nspeaking quite quietly  “that is a nice useful size  that will do \\r\\nnow i have something to say to you  and you will have to attend very\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 218 \\r\\n\\r\\ncarefully  i consider that you are breaking your compact  in the first\\r\\nplace  you married without asking my leave  and  as i told you  i don’t\\r\\nlike women in the house  but i will say nothing about that  as we had\\r\\nnot spoken about it before  but how can you explain about all the fine\\r\\nclothes that your wife fetched home to day  she has taken them to her\\r\\nroom and not given one to me ”“nay ” cried the ploughman  “they are my wife’s clothes  not mine ”“nonsense ” said the gnome  “you gave her the money for them  now\\r\\nunderstand that whatever she buys for herself in the future  she must\\r\\nbuy the same for me  two of everything  dresses  hats  gloves  whatever\\r\\nshe has  i must have too  and be sure that mine are quite as good as\\r\\nhers ”“but how am i to manage that ” cried the ploughman  “how can i explain\\r\\nit to her without telling her that you are there ”“that is your business ” said the gnome  “all i say is that i must\\r\\nhave the things if i am to remain in your house  you can tell her what\\r\\nyou please  so now you know  and see that you do as i tell you ” and\\r\\nsuddenly the little figure shrunk up till it was about the size of a\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 219 \\r\\n\\r\\nblack beetle  and then disappeared down the hole without another word the ploughman rubbed his head  and wondered what he could do  he did\\r\\nnot at all want to tell his wife about the little gnome  for he was\\r\\nsure she would not like it  but at the same time he did not want the\\r\\ngnome to leave his house and take away his luck a few days after  his wife told him she was going to the shoemaker’s\\r\\nto buy herself some smart new shoes  and the ploughman thought of the\\r\\ngnome  and knew he must do as she had told him  so he said to his wife \\r\\n“wife  when you get those shoes for yourself  i wish you would get a\\r\\npair just like them for my cousin who has written to me to ask me for a\\r\\npresent  i should like to send her some nice boots and shoes as she is\\r\\nvery poor  so i shall be very much obliged if you will get two pairs of\\r\\nwhatever you may get for yourself that i may send her one ”the wife wondered very much  for she did not know the ploughman had any\\r\\ncousin  however  she went into the town  and brought home two pairs of\\r\\nsmart red shoes with bows on the top  pg 220 when she had gone to bed at night  the ploughman took one pair and\\r\\nlaid it by the hole in the same place where he had put the food  and\\r\\nit disappeared just as the food did without his seeing where it went \\r\\n“now ” thought he  “when she sees i am quite honest  perhaps the ugly\\r\\nlittle gnome will be content  and let us go on in peace ”so time went on  and the ploughman and his wife lived very happily\\r\\nand quietly  till one evening a pedlar came round with a tray holding\\r\\nall sorts of pretty things to sell  the ploughman’s wife went to the\\r\\ndoor  and looked at the things  then she bought a pretty comb for her\\r\\nhair  but she would not show it to her husband  as she meant to wear it\\r\\nbefore him as a surprise next day but that evening after his wife had gone to bed  as the ploughman\\r\\nsat finishing his pipe by the fire  he heard the voice from the hole\\r\\ncalling as loudly as ever  “stop  i am coming up ” again the ploughman\\r\\nquaked with fear  and then he saw coming through the hole something no\\r\\nbigger than a black beetle  and again the voice said in a lower tone \\r\\n“now i will begin to grow a little ” and presently the tiny black\\r\\nthing had swelled into the ugly little black woman with the face like\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 221 \\r\\n\\r\\nindia rubber “listen to me ” she said  “and know that i am beginning to feel very\\r\\nangry  you are beginning to cheat me  to day your wife bought herself\\r\\na brand new comb from a pedlar at the door  and never got one for me \\r\\nto morrow evening i must have that comb  i don’t care how you get it \\r\\nbut have it i must ”the ploughman scratched his head and was sore perplexed  “what on earth\\r\\nam i to do ” he cried  “for my wife will think me very cruel if i take\\r\\naway all the pretty little things she buys for herself ”“i can’t help that ” answered the gnome  “i have got to have that comb\\r\\nby this time to morrow night  and i warn you if you begin to deceive\\r\\nme  just as if i were an ordinary human being  i shall pretty soon take\\r\\nmyself off ” and with that the gnome disappeared through the hole in an\\r\\ninstant next morning at breakfast the wife came down with the new comb in her\\r\\nhair  and said to her husband  “see  husband  i bought this of the\\r\\npedlar yesterday  and he tells me they are quite the newest fashion \\r\\n\\r\\n pg 222 \\r\\n\\r\\nand all the great ladies in town are wearing them ”“well ” quoth the ploughman  “such a fashion may be all very well for\\r\\nthe great ladies who have scarce any hair of their own  but  for my own\\r\\npart  i had rather see your beautiful hair just as it is without any\\r\\nadornment ”at this the wife pouted  and was very cross  “’tis too bad of you\\r\\nto say that  i thought you would like your wife to wear all the new\\r\\nfashions  and be smart like other folks ”“nay ” cried the ploughman  “my wife is much prettier than other folks \\r\\nand she looks prettiest of all when she has little to adorn her  if any\\r\\nof these great ladies had hair like yours you may be sure they would\\r\\npretty soon throw away any combs or caps or pins  so that nothing but\\r\\ntheir hair should be seen ”when her husband was gone  the wife went to her glass and looked at\\r\\nherself  and took out the comb and then put it in  and tried it every\\r\\nway  “’tis true  for sure ” said she  “my hair is very beautiful  and\\r\\nmaybe it looks best done up as i used to wear it  still it seems a pity\\r\\nnot to use the comb when i have bought it ” so when her husband came\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 223 \\r\\n\\r\\nback  she said to him  “i believe you are right  husband  and it suits\\r\\nme better not to have anything in my hair  but maybe if you are wanting\\r\\nto send a present to that cousin of yours  you would like to send her\\r\\nthat comb  it would save buying anything fresh ”on this the ploughman laughed to himself  but he thanked his wife very\\r\\nmuch and put the comb in his pocket  in the evening after the wife had\\r\\ngone to bed  the ploughman took it  and put it down by the hole  and\\r\\nthen went on smoking his pipe without waiting to see if it disappeared \\r\\nbut in a few minutes he heard the voice crying  “stop  i am coming up ”\\r\\nand saw again the gnome come through the hole and then begin to grow as\\r\\nbefore  “now this is too bad ” cried the ploughman  “what can you want\\r\\nnow  here i have just given you the comb you wanted  and nothing else\\r\\nnew has come into the house ” “on the contrary ” answered the gnome  “i\\r\\nconsider that you have brought a great many new things into the house\\r\\nsince i came to live here  and i mean now to have my choice of some of\\r\\nthem  since i do not find that you are honest enough to offer them to\\r\\nme  to begin with  i want your wife’s hair  i have been trying mine\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 224 \\r\\n\\r\\nwith that comb  and i find i can’t make it do at all  and so i mean to\\r\\nhave your wife’s ”“my wife’s ” gasped the ploughman  “you must be mad ”“mad or not mad ” replied the gnome  “i mean to have it  and  moreover \\r\\nit is my due  you married without consulting me  and if i kept you to\\r\\nyour bargain  i should have a great deal that i have not got  certainly\\r\\nyour wife has the best head of hair in the house  so you must cut it\\r\\noff near her head and bring it all to me ”“but whatever shall i say to my wife ” cried the ploughman in distress “that is your look out  not mine ” said the gnome  “anyhow you have got\\r\\nto give it to me  but as the thought of it seems to annoy you i will\\r\\ngive you a week to get it in ”the ploughman sat and thought and thought  and very sad did he feel\\r\\nat thinking of all his wife’s beautiful hair being given away to the\\r\\nlittle gnome next day he took his horse and cart  and told his wife he had to go for\\r\\na long drive on business to a big town  a long way off  it was quite\\r\\nthe biggest town in that neighbourhood  and many very fine people\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 225 \\r\\n\\r\\nlived there  at first the wife wanted to go too  but her husband said\\r\\nit was too far and she would be too tired  as he could not be back till\\r\\nvery late at night next morning  when they sat at breakfast  he told his wife all he had\\r\\nheard and seen in the big town  and then he added  “and all the very\\r\\nfine ladies there have now the funniest fashion ”“and what is that ” asked his wife  “pray tell me  for i love to hear\\r\\nthe new fashions ”“why ” said the ploughman  “’tis with their hair  instead of wearing it\\r\\nlong  they have it cut quite close all round their heads  because they\\r\\nsay it looks smarter now ”“well  i do call that a silly fashion ” said the wife  “they can’t have\\r\\nhad much hair to consent to have had it cut off ”“no  indeed ” said her husband  “and yet with some of them  they look\\r\\nvery smart and pretty with their little curly heads ”“much like boys  i should think ” said the wife scornfully “no  not quite that  either ” said the ploughman  “more like the\\r\\npictures of angels in the old churches  and they say it is the great\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 226 \\r\\n\\r\\nthing for it to curl up all round the head  and when it does that of\\r\\nitself  they are very proud of it ”“well  then  some of them might be very proud of mine ” said the wife \\r\\n“for it’s as curly as may be  and if i were to cut it short would be\\r\\nall in tiny curls ”when her husband had gone to his work  the ploughman’s wife could do\\r\\nnothing but think of the strange new fashion of which her husband had\\r\\ntold her  “i wonder how it would suit me ” she thought  and when he\\r\\ncame in to dinner she said to him—“husband  is it really true that all those fine ladies looked very\\r\\npretty and smart with their hair short ”“ay  that they did ” he said  “i was quite surprised to see them  and\\r\\ni heard they said ’twas a wonderful saving of trouble  and that their\\r\\nhair could never grow untidy ”“that is true ” said the wife  “yet i should be sorry to cut mine off ” pg 227 8 \\n“no need that you should ” said the ploughman  “and there are not many\\r\\nfolks up here to see if we are in the fashion or not  all the same \\r\\nyou are sure to look prettier than the town ladies any way  whichever\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 229 \\r\\n\\r\\nway your hair is done  for your face is prettier ”but when her husband had gone away again the wife went to her glass\\r\\nwith the scissors in her hand  “as my husband says ” she quoth  “it\\r\\nwould be a wonderful saving of trouble  and then it would be very nice\\r\\nto let all the women round see that i could be in the fashion before\\r\\nthey  i wonder how it would look ” and she snipped off a big bit  “here\\r\\ngoes ” she cried  “after all ’tis best to follow the fashions  whatever\\r\\nthey are ” and she went on cutting till  when her husband came in  he\\r\\nfound her with her hair all cut off beside her “there  husband ” cried she  “do i look like the smart ladies in town ”“ay  that you do ” he answered  “only ten times prettier  but as for\\r\\nall that beautiful hair  you must just give it to me  for it is so\\r\\nbeautiful i would not let it be lost for anything ” and he took up all\\r\\nthe heap of fine gold hair and tied it together with a bright ribbon the wife looked at herself in the glass  and thought she really looked\\r\\nvery nice with little curls all round her head  and though the\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 230 \\r\\n\\r\\nploughman grieved over it in his heart  yet he was glad he had got her\\r\\nhair  and thought  “now at last that miserable little gnome will be\\r\\ncontent  and leave me alone ” so that evening  when his wife was gone\\r\\nto bed  he took the bunch of hair and laid it near the hole  and it\\r\\ndisappeared  and he knew the gnome had it so for a time all went on quietly with the ploughman  and he hoped he\\r\\nshould not hear more of the gnome  but one evening  after his wife had\\r\\ngone to bed and he was in the kitchen smoking his pipe alone  he heard\\r\\nthe hated voice shouting  “stop  i am coming up ” and then he saw the\\r\\nlittle black thing like a black beetle coming through the hole  and all\\r\\nhappened just as before “well  what do you want now ” cried the ploughman when he saw the ugly\\r\\nlittle woman in front of him  “i have given you my wife’s hair  and\\r\\nsurely you ought to be content ”“not at all ” said the gnome  “for i have tried on her hair  and i find\\r\\nit does not suit my complexion  i have never seen her myself  and i\\r\\ndon’t think you any judge  but i heard you telling her that her face\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 231 \\r\\n\\r\\nwas prettier than any of the town ladies  in that case you have no\\r\\nright to keep it for yourself  i must have your wife’s face ”“my wife’s face ” screamed the ploughman  “i think you must be mad  how\\r\\ncan i give you my wife’s face  and what would you do with it ”“wear it ” answered the gnome  “and all you have to do is to fetch your\\r\\nwife in here this day week  and tell her what i wish  and i will come\\r\\nup and scrape off as much of her face as i want ”“why  it would kill her ” cried the ploughman “not at all ” said the gnome  “neither would it hurt her  for she would\\r\\nscarcely feel my little knife  the only thing is  that when i have\\r\\ndone  her skin will be rather black and shrivelled like my own  but as\\r\\nmine has been good enough for me all these years  it will surely be\\r\\ngood enough for a common human woman  anyhow  now you know  i must have\\r\\nyour wife’s complexion to wear with her hair  or else i go at once  and\\r\\nas it will be you who have broken the compact  i shall take all your\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 232 \\r\\n\\r\\nwealth with me ” and repeating in a deep voice  “remember  this day\\r\\nweek at twelve o’clock ” the gnome grew small  and disappeared through\\r\\nthe hole next day the ploughman was very miserable  and whenever he looked at\\r\\nhis wife felt inclined to burst into tears  the wife  not knowing what\\r\\nwas amiss  tried to cheer him  and asked if he were ill  but he shook\\r\\nhis head  and told her “no ” and had not the courage to tell her the\\r\\ntruth  thus things went on  the ploughman growing sadder and sadder\\r\\nevery day  till the evening before that on which the gnome had told him\\r\\nhe must bring his wife to meet her  the ploughman was scarce able to\\r\\ncheck his sobs before his wife  and at last she came into the kitchen \\r\\nand there found him crying outright when she saw this  she kneeled down by him  and said  “husband  you\\r\\nsurely do not think me a good wife  for a good wife shares all her\\r\\nhusband’s troubles  tell me what troubles you  two heads are better\\r\\nthan one  and perhaps i can help you ”then the ploughman told her all about the hated gnome  and how he had\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 233 \\r\\n\\r\\nfound it in a field  and how he had promised to give it some of the\\r\\nbest of everything  and now how it wanted her face at first the wife would scarcely believe it  and then she cried  “but\\r\\nif ’tis such a little creature why not pick it up and strangle it  or\\r\\nlet me put my foot on it  while it is no bigger than a black beetle ”“nay  do not think of such a thing ” said her husband  “for it is ill\\r\\nto play tricks with fairy folk  and most likely she would kill us\\r\\noutright ”“but part with my face i never will ” cried the wife “then we will let her go and take with her the house and all our\\r\\nwealth  and be contented to live in my old cottage again  and be quite\\r\\npoor folk ” said her husband on hearing this the wife burst into tears  and wept more bitterly than\\r\\nher husband  for she would not stop at all  it was in vain for him to\\r\\ntry to cheer her and tell her that poor folk could be quite as happy\\r\\nas rich ones  she declared she could never be happy poor  then when\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 234 \\r\\n\\r\\nhe said if she would let her face go  he would love her just as much\\r\\nor more without it  she cried that she could never be happy with a\\r\\ndreadful shrivelled black skin like a monkey’s  all that night she\\r\\ncried  and when morning came her skin was all red  and her eyes could\\r\\nscarce be seen  so swelled were their lids  but still she cried on all\\r\\nday  and her husband said nothing to comfort her  because he did not\\r\\nknow what to say  by the time it grew dark  her face was so swelled and\\r\\nsore that she could not bear to touch it  and she had cried herself\\r\\nalmost blind  but still the tears were rolling down  when the time came\\r\\nfor the clock to strike twelve  her husband took her hand and led her\\r\\nto the kitchen  and there she sat with her face in her hands sobbing \\r\\njust as the clock struck  they heard the voice like thunder shouting \\r\\n“stop  i am coming up ” and the wife peeped between her fingers and\\r\\nsaw the little thing no bigger than a black beetle come through the\\r\\nhole and then grow  and grow  and grow  till it was like an ugly little\\r\\nblack woman near a foot high  and when she saw how hideous it was she\\r\\n\\r\\n pg 235 \\r\\n\\r\\nthought  “never  never will i consent to have a skin like that—not for\\r\\nmillions of pounds ”the gnome did not speak to her  but said to the ploughman  “so you have\\r\\nbrought your wife  that is a good thing  if you wish me to remain with\\r\\nyou  so now tell her to take down her hands and let me see this face\\r\\nyou make such a fuss about  i have my knife all ready ”and the ploughman saw that she had in her hand a tiny knife  which did\\r\\nnot look as if it could hurt any one “wife  wife ” groaned the ploughman  “what shall we do ”then the wife looked up out of her swollen eyes  and was just going to\\r\\nspeak  when the gnome gave a shriek  “what ” she cried  “that face  do\\r\\nyou mean to say that is what you think so pretty  and that i am going\\r\\nto change my beautiful  dry  black skin for that swollen red mass  no \\r\\nindeed  you must be mad  it is a good thing that i saw it in time  i\\r\\nshall leave the house at once ”“nay ” cried the ploughman  “but it is you who are breaking your\\r\\ncompact this time ” pg 236 but the gnome made no reply  but scuttled down through the hole as fast\\r\\nas it could  and the ploughman and his wife burst out laughing for joy \\r\\nand that was the last they ever saw of it  and it must have gone right\\r\\naway  but they knew it had left some of its luck behind it  as
